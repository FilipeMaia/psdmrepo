- renamed "dimensions" attribute into "shape"
- implemented support for "shape_method" attribute in XmlReared
- default shape_method name changed to use accessor name (if defined)
- added "variable" property to Type meaning that instances can have
  different size (true for CsPad::Element types)
- generation of _sizeof and member access methods now understand 
  variable types

- adding support for the unknown-size types in pds2psana backend:
  - adding size argument for the constructor declaration of such types
  - definition of the constructor cannot be generated at this time
    and has to be added manually
  - there is exactly one type now which needs this, so manual definition
    is probably OK
