- bitfieds now have accessor attribute which generates methods
  for accessing bitfield values
- above is needed to generate (calls to) constructors which take
  bitfield values, auto-generated constructors now accept
  bitfield values instead of whole attribute value
- more progress on HDF5 generator, Xml parser now has code
  to parse HDF5 schema

- use templates ($name substitution) instead of formatting (%s) for 
  code generation in many places.
- at some point it may be beneficial to switch to more advanced
  templating system than to keep all stuff in Python code.

- extending method generation capabilities
- methods may have "rank" attribute which cases return type to be 
  ndarray<Type, Rank>
- methods may have "code" element instead of "expr" which can specify
  full methods body

- renamed "dimensions" attribute into "shape"
- implemented support for "shape_method" attribute in XmlReared
- default shape_method name changed to use accessor name (if defined)
- added "variable" property to Type meaning that instances can have
  different size (true for CsPad::Element types)
- generation of _sizeof and member access methods now understand 
  variable types

Tag: V00-00-04
2011-03-30 Andy Salnikov
- adding support for the unknown-size types in pds2psana backend:
  - adding size argument for the constructor declaration of such types
  - definition of the constructor cannot be generated at this time
    and has to be added manually
  - there is exactly one type now which needs this, so manual definition
    is probably OK
