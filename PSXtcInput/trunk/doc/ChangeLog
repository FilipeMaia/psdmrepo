Please describe any modifications that you made to the package in the
reverse time order.

Tag: V00-15-16
2015-05-22 Christopher O'Grady
- Add bounds checking for number of epics sources, and
  increased max value, after learning that opal cameras
  can look like epics sources when in timetool mode.
	
Tag: V00-15-15
2015-03-5 David Schneider
- JIRA issue PSAS-85, add live mode support
	
Tag: V00-15-14
2015-03-3 David Schneider
- small data JIRA issue PSAS-85
- extend XtcInputModuleBase for small data
  detect live mode, 
  construct and use SmallDataProxy for every smd datagram
- fillEvent - was adding control stream datagrams to the event twice, and the
  dispatch was catching the duplicate key exception - change code to add control
  stream datagrams once
	
Tag: V00-15-13
2015-02-17 Christopher O'Grady
- Fix bug where software was looking for a configure transition
  in the second chunk of an ioc recorder stream.

Tag: V00-15-12
2015-02-12 David Schneider
- add parameter PSXtcInput.XtcInputModule.runLiveTimeout to get psana to wait for 
  new runs in live mode. JRIA issue PSAS-108

Tag: V00-15-11
2015-02-02 Christopher O'Grady
- Fix bug that was preventing IOC recorder EPICS data from getting into the
  eventstore:  send all IOC configure transitions together with the
  DAQ configure. Add correct XtcFileName objects to XtcInput::Dgram
  creation, so XtcInputModuleBase can handle the different configure
  datagrams correctly.

Tag: V00-15-10
2015-01-28 Christopher O'Grady
- Generate a fatal error when data is analyzed that has different
  archiving rates for different epics variables (unsupported by
  indexing).  This can be changed into a warning if the user
  sets allow-corrupt-epics in the [psana] section of the cfg file.

Tag: V00-15-09
2014-11-26 David Schneider
- Fix bug introduced in V00-14-00 which causes psana to hang on empty xtc file - see JIRA Issua PSAS-74

Tag: V00-15-08
2014-11-13 Christopher O'Grady
- Switch to protected accessor functions to override features not
  supported by XtcInputModuleBase.  Add warning messages.

2014-11-12 Christopher O'Grady
- Disable some XtcInputModuleBase features not supported by indexing.
  No tag until Dimosthenis confirms it fixes the problem he observes.

Tag: V00-15-07
2014-11-06 Christopher O'Grady
- Handle case where last calibcycle in a run has no events.
	
Tag: V00-15-06
2014-11-03 Christopher O'Grady
- Fix a bug in the access to calibcycle times: multiple
  streams' calibcycles were being included in the list.
  To avoid duplicates, reduced it to just one stream's
  calibcycles (since they are all identical).
	
Tag: V00-15-05
2014-10-21 Christopher O'Grady
- Change behavior of indexing to provide access to first
  run's configure transition at module beginJob time.
	
Tag: V00-15-04
2014-09-02 David Schneider
- Change options from second event to third event to allow modules to process
  original beginRun and determine run number if needed. New options are
        PSXtcInput.third_event_jump_offsets
        PSXtcInput.third_event_jump_filenames
	
Tag: V00-15-03
2014-09-03 Christopher O'Grady
- Fix bug where it was possible to go past the end of the
  idxcalib array when looking for the array-offsets of the
  first event in each calibcycle.

Tag: V00-15-02
2014-08-27 David Schneider
- add config file options to set xtc file offsets before reading second event
  options are: PSXtcInput.second_event_jump_offsets  
	       PSXtcInput.second_event_jump_filenames
  each option should be a list with the same number of elements.
- minor change to XtcInputModuleBase.cpp.


Tag: V00-15-01
2014-08-20 Christopher O'Grady
- Add ability to get EventTime's for a user-selectable calib cycle

Tag: V00-15-00
2014-07-18 David Schneider
- Control stream support: trac ticket #279. Look for matching dgrams for an
  event. Use rough second and fiducial match.
- add methods to fill event/env from dgram list. control vs DAQ and transition
  type affects fill.
- do not clear AliasMap, merge aliases, trac ticket #314
- API change: store XtcInput::DgramList rather than Pds::Dgram in Event
- new [psana] config parameter: first_control_stream  (defaults to 80)
- new [psana] config parameter: max_stream_clock_diff (defaults to 85)
  this is max difference in seconds.

Tag: V00-14-10
2014-07-18 Christopher O'Grady
- Fix/simplify timestamp sorting.  Previous code failed on
  xppi0414 run 61.

Tag: V00-14-09
2014-07-18 Christopher O'Grady
- Add Index::end method to allow user to indicate when they
  are done with accessing a file randomly (sends an EndRun transition)

Tag: V00-14-08
2014-06-23 Christopher O'Grady
- Handle large events more intelligently (previously would crash if
  event exceeded maximum size).  Also fix bug where
  if an index file was missing, it was still in the xtc file list.
  Now those two lists of files should be more "synchronized".

Tag: V00-14-07
2014-06-16 David Schneider
- keep counter for events to pass to epicsStore.store function:
  Allows epicsStore to save later pv from multiple IOC recorders
  Allows Translator to translate timetool pvs, trac ticket #310

Tag: V00-14-06
2014-06-13 Christopher O'Grady
- Fix a crash when jumping to last event in a file.

Tag: V00-14-05
2014-05-13 Christopher O'Grady
- Add support for ioc recorder streams that are integrated
  with the DAQ.  If an index file is not found, now a warning
  is just printed (before it used to be fatal).

Tag: V00-14-04
2014-05-13 Christopher O'Grady
- Forgot to commit two of the files.  Try again.

Tag: V00-14-03
2014-05-13 Christopher O'Grady
- Change to use new EventTime object for index event selection.
  (allows use of fiducial in timestamp comparison).
  Eliminate some indexing-related exceptions and use fatal MsgLog instead.
  Search for configure/beginrun transitions better (previously
  assumed they were the first and second transition in a chunk0).
  Fix case with multiple EpicsArch generators where an older non-event
  datagram could incorrectly overwrite the values from a newer
  non-event datagram.

Tag: V00-14-01
2014-04-25 Christopher O'Grady
- move creation of DamageMap object.  Fixes crash when multiple
  event-datagrams are returned by the DgramSource (previously
  evnt.put(DamageMap) would have been called multiple times)
	
Tag: V00-14-00
2014-04-16 Christopher O'Grady
- many changes to support xtc indexing
	
Tag: V00-13-00

  from XTC files (actually from datagram reader queue)
