Tools for testing - presently a Python psana Dump module generated from the ddl.

Detailed description:
=====================

Package provides a module dump, psana -m psana_test.dump datasource

During the the beginJob, the module will dump everything from the config store.
During the event, the module will dump all the event keys.
Epics is skipped.

Orovides a useful function to write a psana object to a string.

import psana_test

...
print psana_test.obj2str(myobject)

for ndarrays, a checksum is printed, as well as quantile statistics 
(min, 25th, 50th, 75th and max values).

Output is intended to test refactoring of Psana, or comparing how Psana 
processes two different input sources that should produce the same
output (such as hdf5 vs. xtc).
