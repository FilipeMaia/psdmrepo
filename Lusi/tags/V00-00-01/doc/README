Brief description:
==================

This package is primarily for the global "fixes" that may be required in
every C++ source file.

Detailed description:
=====================

The main "interface" for this package is the Lusi.h header file. It is 
supposed to be included in every C++ *source* file (that is .cpp) and
not header file. It would provide global "fixups" in case anything is 
needed in the future for specific platform/compiler.
