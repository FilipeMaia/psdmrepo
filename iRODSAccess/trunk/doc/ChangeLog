- few updates related to SCGI server (mod_scgi in particular)
- we are switching to mod_scgi instead of mod_wsgi, services will run
  outside apache now from our standard accout, location of few files
  has changed because of that so config needs update
- mod_scgi does not set SCRIPT_NAME correctly, I'm adding new middleware 
  which takes care of this
