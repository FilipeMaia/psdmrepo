# when a LCLS user chooses automatic translation to hdf5 for their experiments,
# either the straightforward automatic translator, or the online monitoring
# translator for multi-calic cycle experiments, this is the psana config file 
# that will be used to pick up any psana configuration that the Web Portal 
# data management system does not set directly for translation.
#
# However users may want to add their own psana modules  to the translation. 
# The web portal of experiments allows users to specify their own release 
# directory and their own config file for automatic translation. By default,
# this is the config file used, but users are encouraged to modify it if need
# be.
#
# The most important thing to be mindful of when modifying this config file
# for automatic translation, is to keep Translator.H5Output at the last module 
# in the psana modules parameter below:

[psana]
modules = cspad_mod.CsPadCalib Translator.H5Output

# to get calibrated cspad in the translation, keep cspad_mod.CsPadCalib at the
# beginning of the modules line. Now add any user modules *IN BETWEEN* those two.
# If user modules come after Translator.H5Output, their output will not be
# translated.

[Translator.H5Output]
# here is where you would set any Translator specific options you require.
# Several Translator.H5Output options cannot be set through the config file
# as they are controlled through the data management system. The controlled 
# parameters are:
#
# overwrite=
# output_file=   (based on experiment)
# split_cc_in_subdir=     # this is only relevant to users using the
#                         # online monitoring translator - however users
#                         # can have this option set through the web page
#                         # on the data management system
#
# Below we highlight a few options useful for online monitoring. online
# monitoring uses the MPI split scan translator. These options do not affect
# the normal translator

fast_index=1   # although not guaranteed to work 100% of the time, this provides
               # the fastest option for using hdf5 with online monitoring.
               # Set fast_index=0 to use the slower, but more stable method of 
               # split scan translation

# below are two options that control the fast index search - if fast index fails, 
# increasing fi_num_blocks may still be faster than setting fast_index=0
# fi_mb_half_block=12        
# fi_num_blocks=50           

unknown_src_ok=0  # online monitoring users find this useful - set to 1 if
                  # filtering a DAQ alias that is in some runs but not others

[PSXtcInput.XtcInputModule]
# Online monitoring sometimes needs to set this option, however it is controlled
# through the data management system - an option should be available to set it 
# throught the web page if need be
# liveTimeout=120
