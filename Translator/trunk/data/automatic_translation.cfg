# when a LCLS user chooses automatic translation to hdf5
# for their experiments, this is the psana config file that
# will be used to identify the psana modules to use 
# for translation. The web portal of experiments allows users
# to specify their own release directory and their own 
# config file for automatic translation. 
#
# When creating your own config file for automatic translation
# to load your own psana modules, specify these in between
# cspad_mod.CsPadCalib and Translator.H5Output below

[psana]
modules = cspad_mod.CsPadCalib Translator.H5Output

# note, several Translator.H5Output options cannot be
# set through the config file during automatic translation.
# They will be set through the command line (which will override
# values in the config file). These options are:
# overwrite=True
# output_file=   (based on experiment)
