# when an LCLS user uses the web portal of experiments to manage standard HDF5
# translation this is the psana config file that will be used to 
# pick up any psana configuration that the data management system does not 
# set directly for translation. Note: this is not the config file for the 
# online monitoring translator that can be used with multi-calib cycle 
# experiments, see the file monitoring_translation.cfg for that tool.
#
# Users may want to add their own psana modules to the translation. 
# The web portal of experiments allows users to specify their own release 
# directory and their own config file for automatic translation. Users are 
# encourages to make a copy of this config file, modify it, and specify it
# in the web page.
#
# The most important thing to be mindful of when modifying this config file
# for automatic translation, is to keep Translator.H5Output at the last module 
# in the psana modules parameter below:

[psana]
modules = cspad_mod.CsPadCalib Translator.H5Output

# to get calibrated cspad in the translation, keep cspad_mod.CsPadCalib at the
# beginning of the modules line. Now add any user modules *IN BETWEEN* those two.
# If user modules come after Translator.H5Output, their output will not be
# translated.

[Translator.H5Output]
# here is where you would set any Translator specific options you require.
# Several Translator.H5Output options cannot be set through the config file
# as they are controlled through the data management system. The controlled 
# parameters are:
#
# overwrite=
# output_file=   (based on experiment)
#
# See the page https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/PSDM/The+XTC-to-HDF5+Translator
# for complete documentation on using the Translator. In particular the section
#
# https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/PSDM/The+XTC-to-HDF5+Translator#TheXTC-to-HDF5Translator-PsanaConfigurationFileandallOptions
#
# includes an expandable widget that gives one all the Translator options.
