# when an LCLS user uses the web portal of experiments to manage 
# online monitoring HDF5 translation for multi-calib cycle experiments,
# this is the psana config file that will be used to pick up any psana 
# configuration that the data management system does not set directly 
# for translation. Note: this is not the config file for the standard
# translation - rather the file automatic_translation.cfg is used.
#
# Users may want to add their own psana modules to the translation. 
# The web portal of experiments allows users to specify their own release 
# directory and their own config file for automatic translation. Users are 
# encourages to make a copy of this config file, modify it, and specify it
# in the web page.
#
# The most important thing to be mindful of when modifying this config file
# for monitoring translation, is to keep Translator.H5Output at the last module 
# in the psana modules parameter below:

[psana]
modules = cspad_mod.CsPadCalib Translator.H5Output

# to get calibrated cspad in the translation, keep cspad_mod.CsPadCalib at the
# beginning of the modules line. Now add any user modules *IN BETWEEN* those two.
# If user modules come after Translator.H5Output, their output will not be
# translated.

[Translator.H5Output]
# here is where you would set any Translator specific options you require.
# Several Translator.H5Output options cannot be set through the config file
# as they are controlled through the data management system. The controlled 
# parameters are:
#
# overwrite=
# output_file=   (based on experiment)
# split_cc_in_subdir=     # users can have this option set through the web page
#                         # on the data management system
#
# Below we highlight a few options useful for online monitoring

fast_index=1
               # although not guaranteed to work 100% of the time, this provides
               # the fastest option for using hdf5 with online monitoring.
               # Set fast_index=0 to use the slower, but more stable method of 
               # split scan translation (which is the default)

# below are two options that control the fast index search - if fast index fails, 
# increasing fi_num_blocks may still be faster than setting fast_index=0
# fi_mb_half_block=12        
# fi_num_blocks=50           

unknown_src_ok=0 
                  # online monitoring users find this useful - set to 1 if
                  # filtering a DAQ alias that is in some runs but not others

[PSXtcInput.XtcInputModule]
# Online monitoring sometimes needs to set this option, however it is controlled
# through the data management system - an option should be available to set it 
# throught the web page if need be
# liveTimeout=120
