@defgroup Translator Hdf5 Translator package
 
@section Introduction

The Translator Package implements the psana module H5Output. This translates Psana events into an hdf5 files. We shall call this system psana-translate.  psana-translate replaces o2o-translate.  o2o-translate is part of the package O2OTranslator which has been responsible for translating LCLS xtc files to hdf5 to date. The main reason for developing the new translator is to take advantage of DDL code generation for translating the many xtc data types into hdf5 datasets (implemented in the psddldata and psddl_hdf2psana packages). Developing the new translator as a psana module has also made it easy to support features such as event selection and translation of user data. In addition, as a psana module, this translator now shares all of psana's code for parsing xtc files.

Documentation can be found in the default_psana.cfg file in the Translator/data directory as well as at
