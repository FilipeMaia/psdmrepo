  1. E-logs for facilities

  Investigate the best way of adding special logbooks for so called facilities ('Laser',
  'SXR Instrument', 'AMO Instrument', etc.). Possible options:

  - introduce a subtabs layer under the 'e-log' tab
  (main disadvantage: too many clicks to get to the e-log)

  - add them as separate top-level tabs: 'Laser', 'SXR Instrument', 'AMO Instrument'
  (disadvantage: too many top-level tabs)

  - add a top level tab 'Facilities' (or 'More...') and put these e-logs as separate
  sub-tabs
  (probably the best solution)

  Look at how to avoid (as much as possible) code duplication when implementing e-log
  UI and PHP services.

  2. PDF generators

  Look at how to better follow the MVC pattern for HTML & PDF generation. The idea is to avoid
  code duplication where it's possible.

  3. Dealig with browsers' Refresh and Back buttons
 
  Investigate if it's possible to rewrite the browsers' History object to return
  to the same tab after pressing Refresh.

  Look at possibility to pop-up a dialog to warn a user not to use the Back button
  when the one is pressed (accidentally). Investigate side effects of the second
  dialog which might be automatically launched by browsers under certain conditions.
