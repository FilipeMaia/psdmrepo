_________________________________________
October 28, 2011 (tasks to be implemented)

  - implement the dictionary for (routing) and (instructions). Add database & Web services support for that.
  - migrate transient JavaScript dictionary to use the server backend

  - extend the Web services to return the number of occurances for each dictionary element.
  - warn a user attempting to delete a dictionary element if there is at least 1 client (reference) of it (to it)
  - turn the number of references into a URL landing at the search page on which all cables using this element will be reported

  - proceed to Search and make it compatible with the list of cables in Projects
  - consider restricting the number of cables returned or do not allow editing to speed up the GUI.
    Alternatevly do not show any tools in there. Insted of that use the link to the project to jump straight to that project
    where all editing can be done.

  - update counters on (yellow colored) project header lines after adding/deleting cables
    or changing a status of a cable. Also update the last modification timestamp from
    the 'updated/modified' field returned by the corresponding Web service.

  - eliminate project status 'submitted' and replace it with the collective status
    as explained in secton '2. On overall project status' from October 6, 2011.

  - refined model for the group operations on project's cables: replace 'submit project'
    with operations similar to what is defined for individual cables. The implementation
    should simply loop over eligible cables and invoke operations one-by-one. Functions
    for those operations are already implemented.

  - implement sorting cables according to the 'Sort by' & 'reverse' criteria

  - implement collumn reduction according to checkboxes in the 'Display' group

  - revisit font sizes. Specify the base size for <body> at some main index.php, and
    use relative sizes (% of that base) elswhere in the 'downstream' HTML (static or dynamic).

October 06, 2011 (palling meeting)

  Here is a summary of a discussion (following my mock-up presentation)
  with Amedeo's cable people. Some suggestion are about how to improve/change
  the GUI of the mock-up.

  _______________
  1. Cable status

    Each cable will be allowed to have a separate status:

      Planned
      Registered (AKA "submitted")
      Labeled
      Fabrication
      Ready
      Installed
      Commissioned
      Damaged
      Retired

    Group operations on the whole project (like 'Submit') will stil be allowed.

  ____________________________
  2. On overall project status

    Derive the project status based on a status of included cables as follows:

    - if all cables are in the same state then use that state as the project status
    - otherwise put 'in-progress'

    Add multiple columns on the projects table to indicate statistics on cables
    being in different state:

      Pln Rgs Lbl Fbr Rdy Ins Cms Dmg Rtr
      --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
        0  12   3   0  12   4  23   0   0

  _________________
  3. Editing cables

    Not allow to do so after printing the label.
    Just put the cable into 'Retired' state and start a new cable

  ______________________________________________________________________
  4. Enforced (schema) restrictions for locations & system (device name)

    Apparently there is LCLS naming conventuon guide which requires to limit
    options when entering the following descriptions:

      location / crate / slot / side => system (formal device) name

    Regular users (customers) injecting projects & cables will be given limited
    (and proven to exist) options/choices when entering/modifying cables.
    Administrators will be able to extend the schema in two ways:

    - when editing a cable there will be an option (in the select)
      to allow adding a new location/crate/slot/side

    - or doing this upfronnt using a separate page on the Cable's tab which
      would be implemented similar to Cable type/connector/pin list.

  _________________________
  5. Job numbers generation

    Generate a new number when submitting the project or the first individual cable of
    the project. On top of that implement an administrative control:

    - for mapping user accounts to TLAs
    - and what's the last used or next available job number for each
      registered person

  __________________________
  6. Reports on each project

    There was a request to consider adding various reports on the database. 
    Details will be discussed later when it will be known which reports are
    needed.
