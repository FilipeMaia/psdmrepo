+ move Excel generator to into neocaptar_cable_search.php?...[&format={excel|wiki|text}]
  This will return URL and a name of the file instead of the actual list of cables

+ get rid of neocaptar_projuect_export.php

+ in neocaptar_search.js remember 'var params={}' which was used last time to make the search.
  This will allow to reuse it for a purpose of exporting the last search into a desired format.

+ for visual consistency reason in 'Admin -> Cable Numbers' add the green bar before the table.

+ clear the fields in the 'Create Project' form after successful creation of a new project

+ replace number of cables 'in use' with Search in all Admin pages.

+ implement 'last active' in PHP scripts. This will be shown in the Admin -> Access Control

+ finalize editing Project Attributes by allowing the project owner to modify all but
  the project owner field, and by allowing administrators to reassign projects to other managers.
  Also add a web service for saving attributes in the database and updating the title.

+ load the dictionary as early as possible

+ add pinlist descriptions in the dictionary to allow adding an external URL to some
  document. Allow to modify the dictionary entries to modify those URLs.

+ enable partial editing of cables after they're 'Registered' (got official JOB and CABLE numbers).
  Edit only those fields which are not source and destination location names.

+ implement cable labels in PDF

+ implement project URL which can be used to communicate between various personnel
  involved into cable management. Within each open project add an input field with
  the project URL which can be cut and past.

+ prevent non-privileged project managers from changing cable status. Only managers
  can do so. Ordinary project managers can only create projects and edit cables.

+ send e-mail notifications to all administrators when a new project is created

+ reinforce width of input fields in dictionary and cable editor


- test printing cable labels

- (Amedeo wanted this to be deferred) make Excel spreadsheet document compatible with their
  existing standard (see examples on Confluence page:
  https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/PCDS/XCS+CAPTAR%2C+%28sheets+ordered+by+cable+number%29

- expand the history table to record changes made when editing cables

- Call for workflow review meeting (Amedeo and cable people). This is meant to refine
  the workflow process: who can do what and in which sequence. We may need to define
   more specific roles for people who're involved into implementing the cable requests.

December 16, 2011 (notes after a meeting with Jing)

Input from Jing:


/* BASED ON Jan 4, 2012 discussion with Jing, POSTPONE THIS UNTIL WE WILL
 * GAIN MORE EXPERIENCE WITH THE SOFTWARE. BESIDES, RACKS CAN BE SHARED BY
 * INSTRUMENTS. HENCE THE ONLY UNIQUE THING HERE
 *
 *   location -> rack -> ele(vation at a rack) -> device -> connection (port?)
 *
 *    - introduce a dictionary of instrument names
 *    - add an instrument name as an optional property of a cable. 
 *      [ NOTE: this information is for internal use only. It's not going to propagate
 *              to the official CAPTAR database. ]
 *    - introduce an association between racks and instrument names (in addition
 *      to an existing association between a rack and its location. Use this association
 *      to limit choices of racks if a particular instrument is selected.
 */


  - when 'registering' a cable allow using a non-standard generator of cable numbers
    (the standard one is based on a location name. The non standard one will allow
    choosing any existing registration from the Admin page).

  - extend the 'Admin' page to allow adding arbitrary cable sequences. Perhaps we
    should stop calling them 'locations', but rather call them 'job number sequence'?
    Add a flag indicating that a particular sequence is associated with a location.

  - allow associating a description with a pinlist. This can be a URL onto a remote document
    at Confluence or elsewhere. Actually, give user multiple options here:

      -- build in textual description
      -- URL where to find the description (Confluence, etc.)
      -- upload a file (PDF, or a image format or a text) with a thumbnail preview

  - extend project definition and add the "Assigned To" property to indicate a person who will
    be in charge of executing the project. This is the person with whom we will associate
    job numbers.

  - allow limited editing of cables at the 'Registered' stage. Do not allow editing
    JOB number, CABLE #, and destination name.

  - what about editing project owner/assignee?

  + rename 'system' column of a cable into 'Formal Device Name'

Other comments:

  - cables are processed by three groups: Jing does the planning, Paco/Lupe fabricates
    the cables, and someone installs and tests them.

_________________________________________
December 14, 2011 (tasks to be implemented)

  + extend database schema to keep a track of cable status transitions (when and who)
  + implement 'H' button to display a history in a table of a splash window (Jquery UI modal dialog)
  + do not allow 'L' (Label) button until the cable is registered

  - add project-level group operations for cable states ('Register all Planned projects', etc.).
    Implement sanity checking (only allow registration if all fields are properly filled out).

  - implement database backend for editing project attributed: trigger jobnumber allocation updates
    if changing an owner. Then test registering more cables with the new owner.

  - implement a registry for project owners ('Admin'->'Project Owners')

  + implement other transitions for cable state (Registered->Labeled, etc.)

  - implement e-mail notifications to the project owner when changing cable state.
    Have e-mail notifications be configured in the 'Admin' page.

  + extend the Web services to return the number of occurrences for each dictionary element.
  - warn a user attempting to delete a dictionary element if there is at least 1 client (reference) of it (to it)
  - turn the number of references into a URL landing at the search page on which all cables using this element will be reported

  + implement project search
  - add project 'Reload' button to refresh the list of cables. Make sure to post
    a warning if there is an open editing session.

  + proceed to Search and make it compatible with the list of cables in Projects
  - consider restricting the number of cables returned or do not allow editing to speed up the GUI.
    Alternatively do not show any tools in there. Instead of that use the link to the project to jump straight to that project
    where all editing can be done.

  - refined model for the group operations on project's cables: replace 'submit project'
    with operations similar to what is defined for individual cables. The implementation
    should simply loop over eligible cables and invoke operations one-by-one. Functions
    for those operations are already implemented.

  + implement column reduction according to check-boxes in the 'Display' group

  - revisit font sizes. Specify the base size for <body> at some main index.php, and
    use relative sizes (% of that base) elsewhere in the 'downstream' HTML (static or dynamic).

October 06, 2011 (planning meeting)

  Here is a summary of a discussion (following my mock-up presentation)
  with Amedeo's cable people. Some suggestion are about how to improve/change
  the GUI of the mock-up.

  _______________
  1. Cable status

    Each cable will be allowed to have a separate status:

      Planned
      Registered (AKA "submitted")
      Labeled
      Fabrication
      Ready
      Installed
      Commissioned
      Damaged
      Retired

    Group operations on the whole project (like 'Submit') will still be allowed.

  ____________________________
  2. On overall project status

    Derive the project status based on a status of included cables as follows:

    - if all cables are in the same state then use that state as the project status
    - otherwise put 'in-progress'

    Add multiple columns on the projects table to indicate statistics on cables
    being in different state:

      Pln Rgs Lbl Fbr Rdy Ins Cms Dmg Rtr
      --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
        0  12   3   0  12   4  23   0   0

  _________________
  3. Editing cables

    Not allow to do so after printing the label.
    Just put the cable into 'Retired' state and start a new cable

  ______________________________________________________________________
  4. Enforced (schema) restrictions for locations & system (device name)

    Apparently there is LCLS naming convention guide which requires to limit
    options when entering the following descriptions:

      location / crate / slot / side => system (formal device) name

    Regular users (customers) injecting projects & cables will be given limited
    (and proven to exist) options/choices when entering/modifying cables.
    Administrators will be able to extend the schema in two ways:

    - when editing a cable there will be an option (in the select)
      to allow adding a new location/crate/slot/side

    - or doing this up-front using a separate page on the Cable's tab which
      would be implemented similar to Cable type/connector/pin list.

  _________________________
  5. Job numbers generation

    Generate a new number when submitting the project or the first individual cable of
    the project. On top of that implement an administrative control:

    - for mapping user accounts to TLAs
    - and what's the last used or next available job number for each
      registered person

  __________________________
  6. Reports on each project

    There was a request to consider adding various reports on the database. 
    Details will be discussed later when it will be known which reports are
    needed.
