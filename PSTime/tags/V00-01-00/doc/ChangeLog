- Lots of changes to time class
- moved parsing/formating to separate file/namespace TimeFormat (copied
  over from LusiTime package).
- new file/namespace TimeUtils for various non-member methods, now
  contains only timegm() methods (forwarded to ::timegm() or 
  optionally implemented locally)
- many methods in Time class renamed to be more user-friendly
- many Time methods were removed to clean up interface
