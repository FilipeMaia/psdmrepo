<h1>Package Psana::Ipimb Reference</h1>
Package containing definitions for IPIMB (Intensity Position, Intensity 
        Monitoring Boards) data types.
        
        IPIMB devices are used by several of the LCLS endstations/instruments to measure 
        position and intensity of the X-ray beam. It has four diodes situated around the 
        beamline, and the bias voltage of these diodes measures the intensity of the beam 
        at the location of each diode. By comparing the signal from each diode, the position 
        of the beam can be inferred.

        The classes in this package provide the raw data from these devices. 
        For feature-extracted data from the same devices, take a look at the classes 
        in the lusi package.
