"""
This module is for managing the dependencies between the packages
in the SIT releases.

It keeps the the dependency graph in the construction environment.
The main structure is represented as a dictionary with one entry 
per package. The key is the package name and the value is another 
dictionary with these keys:

  'DEPS' -> list of the packages that this package depends on
  'LIBS' -> list of library names that this package provides
  'LIBDIRS' -> list of directories where the libraries live
  
There are few dictionaries kept in the construction environment:

  'PKG_TREE_BASE' - the dependency tree for base release(s)
  'PKG_TREE'- dependency tree for current (local) release
  'PKG_TREE_LIB' -> libraries built by the package
  'PKG_TREE_BINS' -> binaries built by the package
  
PKG_TREE_BASE is read from the file(s) in the corresponding base release(s).
PKG_TREE is built by the SConsTools and then saved in the file.

One more dictionary with the environment key 'PKG_TREE_BINDEPS' keeps 
the dependencies of every executable. It is a dictionary with the key
being the Node object of the built executable and the value as a list
of the package names that executable needs to link to.
