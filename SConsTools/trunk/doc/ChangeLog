- compilers.py: adding support for RHEL5
- standardExternalPackage.py: new keyword for standardExternalPackage -
  INCLUDES, to link only the specified includes, and not the whole 
  directory. Useful when the external package is installed in /usr.

- symlinks in geninc/ directory are made without using scons rules, but
  directly by standardExternalPackage script itself. Resolves problem 
  with some weird dependencies.

Tag: V00-00-08
2008-10-29 Andy Salnikov
- adding unit test target to the builds
- standardSConscript: few additional keywords: TESTS, UTESTS, SCRIPTS; 
  split standardSConscript() into bunch of functions
- builders.py: make all builders clesses instead of functions, adding
  strfunction() method to the classes, nicer printing of progress
- scons_env.py: adding ALL_TARGETS variable to environment, which is a
  dictionary of the targets for BINS, LIBS, and TEST aliases
- standardExternalPackage: fills in ALL_TARGETS
- standardSConscript: fills in ALL_TARGETS
- SConstruct.main: defines target aliases 'lib', 'bin', 'test'
- lot's of other improvements

- initial import of SConsTools into CVS

- SConstruct.main should be moved into the top release directory as a part
  of the release preparation (or it can also be linked to SConstruct.main)
