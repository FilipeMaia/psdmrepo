Tag: V00-11-02
2015-07-28 Igor Gaponenko
- added linker option '-Wl,--copy-dt-needed-entries' for RHEL7 & GCC48
to compensate for a change in the default behavior of the CC compiler
when looking for undefined symbols in a chain of the shared libraries.
(JIRA PSRT-64)

Tag: V00-11-01
2015-07-07 David Schneider
- scons test unittests, sleep a second to try to fix text file is busy 
  message. Include output of failed unit tests to make it easier to track
  down build problems.

2013-12-16 Andy Salnikov
- doc target: remove target directroy, always re-run generators event if 
  directories are already there

Tag: V00-09-13
2013-09-19 Andy Salnikov
- adding one more doc generator for all python modules/packages (pydoc-all)
- by default all packages that produce python modules add themselves to
  this generator, can be changed with DOCGEN in SConscript as usual

Tag: V00-09-12
2013-09-17 Andy Salnikov
- change how doc target works, packages now decide for themselves to which
  document generator they want to be added (through DOCGEN parameter)
- default env now has 'DOC_TARGETS' key which points to a dictionary
  mapping generator name to list of files or directories (strings, not
  targets).
- standardSConscript and standardExternalPackage are both modified to update
  env['DOC_TARGETS'] based on the value of DOCGEN passed to them
- default (when DOCGEN is not specified) is for standardSConscript() to add
  its package to env['DOC_TARGETS']['doxy-all'] and for 
  standardExternalPackage() to do nothing

Tag: V00-09-11
2013-08-13 Andy Salnikov
- one more place needed default env instead of package env

Tag: V00-09-10

Tag: V00-08-05
2013-02-11 Andy Salnikov
- adding support for collecting links to PHP stuff in ARCHDIR/php directory
- this is activated by presence (and value) of PHPDIR argument to 
  standardSConscript():
  If PHPDIR is a dictionary then it will create symlinks
     $ARCHDIR/php/<key> -> Package/<value> 
  for each key:value pair in the dictionary. If PHPDIR is a string it will
  create symlink
     $ARCHDIR/php/Package -> Package/PHPDIR

  configuration for python
- new script app/psdm-python-config which runs psdm_python tool without
  scons and prints python config, this is used by the latest sit_setup
