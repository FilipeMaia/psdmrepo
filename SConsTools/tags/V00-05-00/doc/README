Brief description:
==================

SConsTools package contains Python modules to be used by SCons for LUSI
release construction. There may also be other scripts or utilities, but
their use should be very limited.

Detailed description:
=====================

Most important file in this package is SConstruct.main. It should be copied 
to the top release directory under the name SConstruct (or linked from the 
top release directory to a file in this package) as a first step of the 
release construction. SConstruct file is used by SCons when it builds release.
SConstruct file itself uses various Python modules from this package and
SConscript files from other packages to describe complete setup to SCons.
SConscript for most standard packages should be simple, most of them will 
call standardSConscript() function defined in the standardSConscript.py
module in this package, passing zero or few optional parameters.
