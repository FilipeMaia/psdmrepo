- method Event::keys() now takes options source argument to limit 
  returned keys only to matching sources

- add support for "AnySource" proxies. These proxies are stored in 
  proxy dictionary with special source address which does not correspond 
  to real source. When get() is called on dictionary with exact source
  address and there is no proxy registered for that address another
  try is done to find "AnySource" proxy and ask it for data.   
- This is added primarily to support calibration-type proxies that 
  can serve calibration data for multiple sources. Not for casual users.
