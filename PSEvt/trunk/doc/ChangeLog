- work on ticket #177 
- all constructors of Source class are made explicit
- comments added to Event class which explain differences between
  overloaded get() method

Tag: V00-05-00
2012-09-11 Andy Salnikov
- Even class now inherits from boost::enable_shared_from_this
- EventId class has new methods fiducials() and vector()

Tag: V00-04-04
2012-07-24 Andy Salnikov
- rhel6/gcc44 migration, added missing headers

Tag: V00-04-03
2012-07-09 Andy Salnikov
- add operator<< for Source class
- Pds::Src printing now correctly prints "matching" sources

Tag: V00-04-02
2012-04-27 Andy Salnikov
- replace shared_ptr(new T) with make_shared<T>

Tag: V00-04-01
2012-01-27 Andy Salnikov
- Source::parse now can understand old detector names

Tag: V00-04-00
2011-10-28 Andy Salnikov
- method Event::keys() now takes options source argument to limit 
  returned keys only to matching sources
- added unit test for that
- fix for EventKEy class to allow assignment operator
- added global operator<<() for Pds::Src class

Tag: V00-03-00
2011-10-04 Andy Salnikov
- add support for "AnySource" proxies. These proxies are stored in 
  proxy dictionary with special source address which does not correspond 
  to real source. When get() is called on dictionary with exact source
  address and there is no proxy registered for that address another
  try is done to find "AnySource" proxy and ask it for data.   
- This is added primarily to support calibration-type proxies that 
  can serve calibration data for multiple sources. Not for casual users.

Tag: V00-02-00
2011-05-06 Andy Salnikov
- few methods in proxy dict classes now take EventKey instead of triplet
  of parameters
- doxygenating headers

Tag: V00-01-00
2011-04-26 Andy Salnikov
- added optional argument to Event::get and matching ProxyDict methods 
  to return the exact source (Pds::Src) of the object.

2011-03-28 Andy Salnikov
- missing return value in ProxyDict::getImpl

Tag: V00-00-06
2011-03-23 Andy Salnikov
- extended psevt-source-unit-test.cpp slightly
- add Event::get method which takes Source in addition to Pds::Src 
- modified ProxyDict to work with Source instead of Pds::Src and 
  do matching if source is not exact

Tag: V00-00-05
2011-03-23 Andy Salnikov
- added Source class and unit test for it

Tag: V00-00-04
2011-03-21 Andy Salnikov

Tag: V00-00-03
