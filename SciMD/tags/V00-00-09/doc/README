The package contains software and data related to an implementation of
the Science Metadata Database.

Detailed description:
=====================

  Database schema
  ===============

  The schema has been developed using MySQL Workbench IDE:
  http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/

  The relevant files have the following (version specific) names and
  meaning:project files (for each version) have the following names:
 
    SciMD_schema_<version>.mwb : the main project file (IDE)
    SciMD_schema_<version>.sql : SQL/DDL statements generated by IDE for the schema
    SciMD_schema_<version>.png : the drawing of the scheme generated by IDE

  Python modules/classes
  ======================


  Binary applications, executable Python scripts
  ==============================================

    SciMDCmd : the management tool written in Python. It allows to explore
               all functionality of the database. Run the tool w no parameters
               or with the only parameter called 'help' to get more information
               on supported commands and their syntax. The '-h' option can also
               be used to get an explanation of all options supproted by the command.


    SciMDTestApp : the C++ application written to test the C++ API to the database
                   and to illustrate its (API) use.

  Libraries
  =========

    The package provides the C++ library with some minimum functionality for
    the Translator. The library allows creating new run records, obtainig
    descriptions of run parameters, and setting/updating values of the parameters.
