2010-02-14 - version 0.3
========================
- major refactoring:
  - split the whole thing into a number of modules, pdsdata becomes a 
    package, module names follow the directory names in pdsdata C++ package
    so that Xtc class is now in pdsdata.xtc.Xtc
  - most of the classes now inherit from either PdsDataType or 
    PdsDataTypeEmbedded
  - Datagram class renamed to Dgram
- bunch of new data types added

2010-02-04 - version 0.2
========================
- added NumPy header location search to setup script
- started implementation of data classes
  - common base class to be used for them is in src/types/PdsDataType
  - src/types/TypeLib hase few useful macros and functions to simplify
    writing of wrappers for member functions
- src/types/camera has implementation of the data types from 
  corresponding pdsdata package
- new script scripts/pyxtcscanner whcih does the same as o2o-scanner
- few methods in Xtc and Datagram classes became attributes (following
  their C++ counterparts as closely as possible).

2010-02-03 - version 0.1
========================
- first import into repository
- just a bunch of XTC-related classes, no specific data types defined yet
