Please describe any modifications that you made to the package in the
reverse time order.

Tag: V00-08-01
2013-03-01 Andy Salnikov
- re-apply changes in V00-07-03, make tag for nightly builds

Tag: V00-08-00
2013-03-01 Andy Salnikov
- undo V00-07-03 to make a tag for ana-0.7.x
- after introduction of read-ahead for headers current file name 
  does not make sense anymore
  - removed XtcStreamDgIter::m_file member and method 
    XtcStreamDgIter::chunkName()
  - added DgHeader::path() method which should be used instead 
    of XtcStreamDgIter::chunkName()
  - replace boost::filesystem::path with XtcFileName in DgHeader
  - XtcFileName adds extension() method
  - XtcStreamDgIter::next() return Dgram object instead of Dgram::ptr

Tag: V00-07-03
2013-02-12 Andy Salnikov
- use new Dataset functionality to find the list of files instead of
  own algorithm

Tag: V00-07-02
2013-01-21 Andy Salnikov
- bug fix in implementation of Shared file, assumed live data even 
  when file extension was not inprogress

Tag: V00-07-01
2013-01-17 Andy Salnikov
- implemented initial algorithm for header sorting in XtcStreamDgIter
- fixed all tests
- added new test for header sorting (test/XtcReadAheadTest.cpp)

Tag: V00-07-00
2013-01-16 Andy Salnikov
- preparing for datagram read-ahead and sorting, for now introduce
  new class DgHeader that will be used in read-ahead
- split XtcStreamDgIter into three classes: SharedFile, DgHeader and
  same XtcStreamDgIter. XtcStreamDgIter now returns DgHeader instead 
  of whole datagram. DgHeader reads datagram when requested. Both
  XtcStreamDgIter and DgHeader used SharedFile class for reading.
- maximum datagram size removed from interfaces (constructors), there 
  is one internal limit on datagram size (256MB) used for checking 
  against header corruption
- there are no changes in the order of datagrams yet, all results should
  be identical to what we had before

Tag: V00-06-06
2012-10-11 Andy Salnikov
- if live database contains no info about files then RunFileIterLive 
  throws exception instead of returning empty "EOF" histogram

Tag: V00-06-05
2012-07-29 Andy Salnikov
- if the queue is full and terminate is called on DgramReader thread
  it will hang forever trying to push one more datagram into a queue,
  fix by removing all datagrams first before adding EOD datagram

Tag: V00-06-04
2012-07-27 Andy Salnikov
- small fixes to doxygen comments

Tag: V00-06-03
2012-07-24 Andy Salnikov
- rhel6/gcc44 migration, added missing headers

Tag: V00-06-02
2012-07-17 Andy Salnikov
- fix a comment

Tag: V00-06-01
2012-07-15 Andy Salnikov
- generate exception when expected live files are not there

Tag: V00-06-00
2012-07-12 Andy Salnikov
- live reading implementation more or less complete, simple tests run OK

Tag: V00-05-02
2012-07-10 Andy Salnikov
- forgot to update unit test for new MergeMode enums

Tag: V00-05-01
2012-07-09 Andy Salnikov
- mergeMode() method also accepts "old" enum names

Tag: V00-05-00
2012-07-09 Andy Salnikov
- a bit of redesign, split iterators into iterators over datagrams
  and iterators over files
- iteration over files has two implementation, first is based on static 
  list of input files as before, second uses database as the source of 
  live data; second implementation is not tested yet

Tag: V00-04-01
2012-06-22 Andy Salnikov
- forgot to update tests to use new class names

Tag: V00-04-00
2012-06-22 Andy Salnikov
- renamed XtcDgIterator class into XtcChunkDgIter, XtcDechunk into
  XtcStreamDgIter
- updated comments in few places

Tag: V00-03-01
2012-06-21 Andy Salnikov
- implementing live mode for XtcDgIterator
- new test app test/XtcDgIteratorTest.cpp

Tag: V00-03-00
2012-06-20 Andy Salnikov
- updated XtcDgIterator to use unbuffered IO, first step to support
  reading live data

Tag: V00-02-02
2012-06-19 Andy Salnikov
- XtcFileName gets a constructor which takes experiemnt id, run number,
  stream and chunk numbers
- added also unit tests for the above constructor
- XtcDgIterator::next allocates minimum necessary space for datagram,
  not maximum allowed size

Tag: V00-02-01
2012-03-05 Andy Salnikov
- adding XtcFilter classes to filter datagram contents, right now only
  one filtering option exists (XtcFilterTypeId class) based on TypeId

Tag: V00-02-00
2012-01-27 Andy Salnikov
- improved handling of out-of-order transitions

Tag: V00-01-02
2011-04-01 Andy Salnikov
- change logging level for few messages

Tag: V00-01-01
2011-03-31 Andy Salnikov
- XtcStreamMerger::next - last change introduced a bug, fixed now
- XtcIterator.cpp: trying to find a workaround for some weird cases 
  with CsPad::ElementV2 reading when nested XTC object indicated larger
  data size than its containing XTC container.

Tag: V00-01-00
2011-03-29 Andy Salnikov
- add support for extracting run number from datagrams stored in a queue
- Dgram is now a class instead of namespace, instances contain pointer 
  to Pds::Dgram and XtcFileName.
- XtcStreamMerge::next() returns Dgram object
- DgramQueue class stores Dgram objects

Tag: V00-00-05
2011-03-20 Andy Salnikov
- fix compilation issue after merge with V00-00-03

Tag: V00-00-04
2011-03-20 Andy Salnikov
- added smart pointer typedef for datagram class and couple of utility
  methods to manage datagram memory.
- changed all users of datagram class to use smart pointer class instead
  of bare pointer

Tag: V00-00-03
2011-02-16 Andy Salnikov
- stop throwing exceptions at premature EOF, printing error message is 
  sufficient.

Tag: V00-00-02
2011-01-26 Andy Salnikov
- returned XtcIterator back to translator package
- XtcIterator class is now a simple tree-traversal iterator which 
  returns one XTC object at a time

Tag: V00-00-01
2011-01-26 Andy Salnikov
- Moved some common classes for XTC reading here from O2OTranslator
