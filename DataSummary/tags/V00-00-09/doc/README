Detailed description:
=====================

A tool to prepare an data summary/data quality report of the data run.
Uses bootstrap and a couple of other packages, but the dependencies
are packaged in this directory.

  data-summary-tool

    The Python cript that will launch a data summary job and automatically
    pick up which sata sources are available, and include some information
    about them.

The data summary tool can be used in the following three ways:

  - locally on a single node in a single core mode,
  - locally on a single node in a multi-process mode with mpirun,
  - or in a batch multi-core mode using the bsub command.

These three examples illustrate each technique:

  data-summary-tool CXI/cxic0114 111
  mpirun -n 6 data-summary-tool CXI/cxic0114 111
  bsub -a mympi -n 24 -o mpi.log -q psanaq data-summary-tool CXI/cxic0114 111
