________________________________________________
1. Continious beam time monitoring: LCLSBeamTime

This application fetches values of certain (see the code of the scripts)
EPICS PVs and puts them into MySQL database (database name 'sysmon').
There are two relevant tables in the database:

  pv     - definitions of PVs and their categories
  pv_val - actual values of the PVs

The application is deployed at the following directory:

  /reg/g/pcds/pds/sysmon/

There are three relevant scripts in the binary sub-directory of
the deployment directory:

  bin/LCLSBeamTimeMonitor.sh

    the driver script to be started aither as a cron job or
    as a procServ process. It will check and set up an execution
    environment for the actual monitoring script.

  bin/LCLSBeamTimeWatch.py

    the actual monitoring script performing continious monitoring
    of the EPICS variables (PVs). The script will invoke a database
    recorder script to store values of the PVs in the database.


  bin/LCLSBeamTimeStore.py

    the script to be invoked to store a value of a select PV in
    the database.

And there is a Python library for MySQL found at:

  lib/python2.5/site-packages

The monitoring is run as follows:

  bin/LCLSBeamTimeMonitor.sh <sampling-interval> <heart-beat-interval>

The first parameter (<sampling-interval>) controls how frequently values of
the EPICS PVs are sampled. The second parameter (<heartbeat-interval>)
controls the hearbeat interval. The monitoring system implements the heartbeat
as a mechanism of signaling to potential recipients of the monitoring
information that the monitoring is still "alive". Both parameters are
expressed in seconds. The minimal allowed values for each is 1 second.
The parameters are optional. Their default values are 10.0 and 20.0 seconds
respectively.

2. Database schema for storing the beam-time usage by experiments

The schema is used for producing various summary reports about data taking
activities at PCDS. The contents of the databas is populatd from various
sources.

The schema is represented in database 'sysmon' by four tables:

  beamtime_config   - configuration parameters of the application
  beamtime_runs     - data taking run records extracted from the Electronic
                      LogBook of teh LCLS experiments
  beamtime_gaps     - gaps of not taking data between runs; the gaps
                      are found automatically based on the above mentioned
                      information about runs
  beamtime_comments - comments with justtifications for the gaps provided
                      by relevant personell involved into data taking
