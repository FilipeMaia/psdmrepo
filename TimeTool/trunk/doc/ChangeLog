- Tag V00-02-00 introdcued a bug - setting dump=0 in Analyze and Setup no
  longer completely turned off histogramming, meaning the .root file was  
  created. Although this file gets overwritten, in an MPI program race conditions
  and errors occur. Fixed bug - now setting dump = 0 in configuration means no
  root file.

- Update Analyze and Setup to look for both EvrData::DataV4 and DataV3.

2015-4-8 David Schneider
- Adapt to new API change for hmgr in PSEnv V00-14-00, adapt to use std:: due to removal of root headers
  JIRA PSAS-131. TimeTool checks if hmgr available. For all modules (Analyze, 
  Setup and Check) the new behavior is to print non fatal errors if histogramming
  was requested. 

Tag: V00-01-05
2015-2-3 David Schneider
- add options to Analyze module allow user to control beam and laser logic.
  Tracks JIRA issue PSAS-102.

2014-12-11 David Schneider
- restore adding results into the psana Event. Note, results are now added
  as TimeTool::DataV2 as opposed to TimeTool::DataV1. Users will have to update  
  their code. Track JIRA issue PSAS-82.

Tag: V00-01-02 
2014-10-23 David Schneider
- change config files to use eventcode_nobeam rather than eventcode_bykik (fix bug
  in config files)
	
Tag: V00-01-01
2014-10-15 David Schneider
- includes Matt's fix for JIRA PSAS-47 (crash when no laser logic given, i.e, 
  laser always on or off).
- additional fix to local TimeToolData constructor in Analyze.cpp which sets
  EventType parameter
- note: there was no ChangeLog entry for Tag V00-01-00. This Tag includes 
  those change as well - from svn message:
  Fix to fill AMPLNXT r9005
  Changed Analyze module to use TimeTool::ConfigV1 for defaults and TimeTool::DataV1 
  when appropriate r8964

	
Tag: V00-00-03
2014-07-31 David Schneider
- added config file option put_ndarrays to TimeTool.Analyze to put Event
  results as ndarrays rather than doubles. ndarrays get converted to
  numpy arrays for Python modules. Allows easier access to results from Python.

Tag: V00-00-02

Tag: V00-00-01
