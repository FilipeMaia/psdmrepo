Brief description:
==================

Modules for analyzing recorded data from a timetool camera setup.
The timetool camera measures the time difference between laser
and FEL in one of two methods: (1) spatial encoding, where the
X-rays change the reflectivity of a material and the laser probes
that change by the incident angle of its wavefront; or (2) spectral
encoding, where the X-rays change the transmission of a material
and the chirped laser probes it by a change in the spectral components
of the transmitted laser.

Detailed description:
=====================

TimeTool/src/Analyze.cpp - a module that analyzes the camera image by
projecting a region of interest onto an axis and dividing by a reference
projection acquired without the FEL.  The resulting projection is
processed by a digital filter which yields a peak at the location of
the change in reflectivity/transmission.  The resulting parameters
are written into the event.

TimeTool/src/Check.cpp - a module that retrieves results from the 
event for either the above module or from data recorded online.

TimeTool/src/Setup.cpp - a module that calculates the reference
autocorrelation function from events without FEL for use in the
digital filter construction.

TimeTool/data/timetool_setup.py - a python script to calculate the
digital filter weights.
