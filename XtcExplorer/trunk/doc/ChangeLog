Package author: Ingrid Ofte

Please describe any modifications that you made to the package in the
reverse time order.

2011-Sep-26 ofte                rev 2433
        - improvements to xtcexplorernew: acqiris 1/2way implemented, not connected. 
	- improved connections between guis

2011-Sep-26 ofte                rev 2429
        - Several small changes
	- To speed up waveforms, I have opted not to display errorbars. Huge difference!!

2011-Sep-26 ofte                rev 2428
        - Added some of the GUI look and feel from xtcexplorernew to the old, 
	 since the new explorer seems might need some more work to finish... if 
	 at all worthwile... ? 
	- Old now has the new file selector, and multiprocessing. 
	
2011-Sep-23 ofte                rev 2425
        - Change the way Plotter and Frames are handled to fix a problem 
	  with colorbar being disconnected when endjob plot appars. In fact 
	  this should handle another problem with memory leak too (too many 
	  "frames" stored)
	- pyana_cspad.py and pyana_image.py changed accordingly. 
	- cspad.py: added functionality to draw a picture from array file 
	  independent of pyana / xtcexplorer. That part isn't properly working 
	  yet, but shouldn't break anything either. More next week... 
	
2011-Sep-22 ofte                rev 2424
        - fixed middle-button reset for cspad&images (utilities.py)

2011-Sep-21 ofte                rev 2419
        - pyana_cspad.py now has the option of saving and background subtract 
	  using a pixel array file of same dimensions as the pedestals file used
	  in psana
	
2011-Sep-20 ofte                rev 2412
        - solved the cspad pixel array problem, still lacks the ability to save it. 
	- improved the axes labeling (ticks) for projection plots of cspad. 

2011-Sep-19 ofte                rev 2411
        - included gaps and margins for full Cspad detector view. Now uses 
	  all the same calibration files as psana uses (potentially at least)

2011-Sep-19 ofte                rev 2410
        - removed pixel save from cspad to "solve" a problem	

2011-Sep-19 ofte                rev 2409
	- save max 100 (parameter) single-shot events (cspad and image (old))
	
2011-Sep-16 ofte                rev 2404
        - minor modifications
	
2011-Sep-16 ofte                rev 2401
	- pyana_image_beta and pyana_plotter_beta added
	- minor changes to new GUI
	
2011-Sep-15 ofte                 rev 2400
	- pyana_cspad.py: small improvements / crash fixes. 
	- utilities.py: Simplification of Data containers
	- pyana_ipimb.py and XtcPyanaControl.py: 'variables' -> 'quantities'
	- additionally, I've added the following modules that allow to run 
	  the new version of the GUI. Not ready yet, but I'd like to get it 
	  into svn anyhow. It can be run with xtcexplorernew and should be 
	  independent of the old one (new classes and new modules) and its 
	  development *should not* break the old xtcexplorer... 
          A       XtcExplorer/app/xtcexplorernew
	  A       XtcExplorer/src/config_pyana.py
	  A       XtcExplorer/src/gui_explorer_main.py
	  A       XtcExplorer/src/gui_config_panels.py
	  A       XtcExplorer/src/gui_pyana_control.py
	  A       XtcExplorer/src/pyana_ipimb_beta.py

	whether or not the event is accepted. 

2011-Jun-22 ofte     V00-01-06     rev 2027
          Tag
	
2011-Jun-22 ofte                   rev 2026
        - fixed a bug in pyana_image (for Princeton)
	- fixed a bug in pyana_encoder (now -1 entries for unvalid entries, needed for time line plot)
	- pyana_image now uses Threshold class instead of the home-made double threshold. 
	- FIXME! pyana_image: There's still a problem when number of plots change from 
	  event to event (e.g. one image passes threshold while the other doesnt). For now, solved
	  by plotting each time anyway, changing title (bright or dark) depending on over/under threshold.
	
2011-Jun-16 ofte                   rev 1995
	- pyana_ipimb: variable list to select what to plot
	- pyana_plotter: avoid drawing every event (slows things down). 
	   Relies on event 'show_event'. Added flag putting to all modules. 
	- pyana_cspad displays average so far, if no darks. To do: accumulate/reset

2011-Jun-09 ofte                  rev 1965
	- Much improved pyana_cspad
	- Supports background subtraction, both from dark file and on-the-fly dark average
	- Supports saving good average and dark average as numpy file. 
	- Supports saving good single-events to file (numpy)
	
2011-Jun-09 ofte                  rev 1964
        - Cleaned up utilities, cspad and image modules somewhat more. 
	- The projections now reflect the (interactive) change of vmin/vmax
	- Allow filtering / skipping events / not running modules downstream 
	  if this shot is not passing threshold (using evt.put(True,'skip_event'))	
	
2011-Jun-08 ofte                  rev 1961
	- Several structural changes to utilities.py and some to 
	  pyana_image and pyana_cspad. Attempt at better organization 
	  and similarity of the two modules. Some additional features 
	  and probably bugs too. Will clean this up further in the coming
	  days. Frame object to hold threshold and other information from 
	  each plot, instead of the Plotter object which contains all plots 
	  (Frames) in one figure canvas.

2011-May-6 ofte               rev 1835
        XtcPyanaControl.py
	- Experimented with threading / subprocesses, but all is restored back I hope. 
	- More GUI control for general settings (display mode, plotting frequency etc, ipython)
	XtcBrowserMain.py
	- added nevents to the transferred info from xtcscanner
	pyana_ipimb.py
	- Changed the plot layout a bit
	pyana_bld.py
	- Added support for the SharedIpimb
	pyana_image.py
	- cleaned up endjob some
	pyana_scan.py
	- experimented with ipython, but restored. 
	- support for shared ipimb included
	pyana_waveform.py
	- More sensible tracking of average waveform
	- removed the non-functioning const threshold routine
	pyana_plotter.py
	- ipython functionality is moved here, although here it doesn't actually work. 
	  Will add a way to get to the "stored" interactive data from this module which 
	  is run last. 
	pyana_cspad.py
	- vrange now separated by comma. 
	- Don't automatically start in interactive mode. Respect the GUI settings. 
	xbplotter.py
	- For drawframe (used by cspad and image), add projection plots	
	
2011-Apr-8 ofte V00-00-18     rev 1792
        - Some tuning. This goes with another version of the confluence documentation. 
	- waveforms still not working. 
	- ipimb filtering / scan should be improved. 

2011-Apr-8 ofte               rev 1786
        - XtcEventBrowser/src/pyana_xppscan.py: fixed some mistake.
	  IPMdiagnostics and IPMfilt utilities done, still some more plotting needed

2011-Apr-7 ofte               rev 1784
        - Almost done implementing the xpp IPMdiagnostics functionality. 
	
2011-Apr-6 ofte               rev 1770
	- added XtcEventBrowser/src/pyana_xppscan.py as a testing module 
	  for adding XPP matlab functionality. Will add to pyana_scan whatever 
	  works well / seems general enough. 
	- XtcPyanaControl now has the (hardcoded, default False) option of 
	  running pyana in a separate *thread*. Need to launch mpl figures from 
	  the GUI, not fully implemented yet, but might be in the future. Could allow
	  for more interactive data manipulation with ipython. For now, 
	  running as separate process is more convenient (currently default). 

2011-Apr-4 ofte               rev 1764
	- Some more plotting for pyana_scan (motor scan)

2011-Apr-1 ofte               rev 1763
	- Remember pyana command line from one run to the next
	- scan wrt control variables by pyana_scan.py. If ControlPV is selected, 
	  a scan will be configured (i.e. no other pyana modules). Else, as before. 
	- pyana_scan still needs some work to be fully functional
	
2011-Mar-31 ofte               rev 1723
	- Fix to XtcScanner to deal with (skip) empty epics records

2011-Mar-29 ofte               rev 1711

        - Display mode: Interactive (plt.show()) or SlideShow(plt.draw()) or None
	- This version needs pyana V00-00-24 or later (use evt.put and evt.get)
