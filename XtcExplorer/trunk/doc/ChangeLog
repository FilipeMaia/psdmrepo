	- some additional features of the xtcscanner (-c max calibcaycle, and counting)
	
2012-Apr-12 ofte         V00-01-22   rev 3193
	- commit all the changes so far, which includes 
	pyana_waveform independence on matplotlib, and a few other fixes.

2012-Mar-5 ofte                       rev 3012
	- little bugfix

2012-Mar-5 ofte                       rev 3011
	- ipimb single display improvement (using GridSpec)

2012-Mar-2 ofte                       rev 3009
        - another bugfix for pyana_ipimb.
	
2012-Mar-2 ofte Tag V00-01-21         rev 3008
2012-Mar-2 ofte                       rev 3007
        - bug fix for pyana_ipimb. Can handle 1 or 2 ipimb sources now. Still to do: 
	- handle multiple ipimb sources, 
	- handle multiple modules for ipimbs. 
	
2012-Mar-1 ofte Tag V00-01-20        rev 3005
	- isolate matplotlib depenency to improve speed and batch processing
	-- utilities.py split into utilities.py and displaytools.py
	-- matplotlib dependency removed from pyana_ipimb and pyana_image modules
	   This change will come to the other modules too, shortly... 
	-- only pyana_plotter.py uses matplotlib
	- pyana_image.py bugfix (dark subtraction had disappeared)
	- max projection for images now available
	- displaytools has a new class DataDisplay that has all the 
	display functionality for each of the data types. This can be 
	made more configurable, but is only using standard display now. 
	pyana_xxx.py files does nothing but store data in data containers 
	and passing it on to the event. pyana_plotter uses DataDisplay for 
	displaying each stored datatype. 
	- pyana_ipimb.py gets the capacitor info and stores for display.
	- improvements to XtcExplorerMain file selection. 
	- automatic path for CsPad calibration files
	
2012-Feb-06 ofte                      rev 2858
	- Fixed a bug in pyana_images title. 
	- Automatic update of revision number in the 'about' gui (hope it works)
	
2012-Jan-26 ofte  Tag V00-01-19        rev 2850
        - I think I've solved the CSPad calib path issue by using AppUtils.AppDataPath 
	  will see once this version gets included in a release. 
	
2012-Jan-26 ofte  Tag V00-01-18        rev 2829
	- Added the Timepix to list of camera sources. 
          Todo: add histogram/spectrum of the image (request from XCS)
	- Loading xtcfiles from command line now also updates the file selection buttons
	  which should make it easier to e.g. switch to a different run in the same experiment. 
	- changed the get fram method for pyana_image_beta to be the same as pyana_image 
	  (use the generic evt.get() and a dicionary looking up the data types for each device)
	
2012-Jan-19 ofte  Tag V00-01-17        rev 2809
         - finished the CsPad pixel map of full image. And commented it out, because 
	 there isn't really much you can do with it, but it can be used if requested. 
	 Plan to move this to a separate pyana/cspad utilities library. 

2012-Jan-18 ofte  Tag V00-01-16        rev 2800
	- Added path parameter to pyana_images, to set correct CSPad tile
	alignment path. Currently needs to be edited into pyana config file 
	by users.
	
2012-Jan-06 ofte                   rev 2760
	- minor edits
	
2011-Dec-13 ofte  V00-01-15                 rev 2755
        - I think all the most obvious bugs have been removed now. 
	- encoder has been updated to use channel mask
	
2011-Dec-09 ofte                 rev 2697
        - moved icons to the 'data' directory. 
	- moved 'calib' to the 'data' directory
	- fixed some more problems prior to tagging. (will need one more iteration of testing after lunch)
	
2011-Dec-08 ofte                 rev 2694
	- pyana_image is quite a bit reduced / cleaned up, and pyana_cspad.py while 
	  still there and valid, is becoming obsolete as it is handled as any other image
	  by pyana_image.py
	- Some GUI work ongoing. Not fully tested yet. 
	
2011-Nov-23 ofte                 rev 2664
         - in the process of cleaning up / improving pyana_image and others
	   There were several problems, from random development over the last months... 
	
2011-Nov-21 ofte                 rev 2663
        - minor changes
	
2011-Nov-11 ofte                 rev 2658
        - fix to xtcplotternew (image plotting)

2011-Nov-11 ofte                 rev 2657
        - fix a plotting problem. 
	- some improvements to xtcexplorernew (waveforms gui)
	
2011-Nov-11 ofte V00-01-13       rev 2625
        - some more tuning, and a tag
	
2011-Nov-11 ofte                  rev 2624
        - waveform interface for explorernew is on the way
	
2011-Nov-08 ofte  V00-01-12       rev 2606
2011-Nov-08 ofte                  rev 2605
        - improved utilities.py plotting, for pyana_waveforms mainly, and the way pyana_waveforms 
	does the plotting. 

	
2011-Nov-01 ofte  	          rev 2587
	- Mainly fixed the suspend-button for xtcexplorernew and unified / improved 
	the behaviour a bit. 
	- cspad save pixels
	- wf... some unfinished improvements. may break. 
	
2011-Oct-25 ofte                  rev 2555
	- fixed a bug with the "full scan" button and file size checking
	- added a "mode" to pyana_waveform that can be 'average' (default) 
	  or 'stack'. The latter stacks waveforms in a 2D array and plots it 
	  like an image plot. Works fine for small arrays, but will run out of 
	  memory if the "image" gets too big. 
	  

2011-Oct-19 ofte                  rev 2534
	- mostly improvemetns to the pyana run control. Added suspend/resume button.
	
2011-Oct-19 ofte                  rev 2532
	- Fixed another bug. The coordinate maps are now correct. They have been 
	  converted to pixel units. 
	
2011-Oct-19 ofte                  rev 2530
          - a fix to the coordinate map, to get the section alignment in. Still missing: 
	    1) convert to pixel units, 2) make use of coordinate map for plotting.
	
2011-Oct-18 ofte                  rev 2528
          - Added cspad coordinate maps, based directly on meterology measurements. 

2011-Oct-13 ofte                  rev 2520
          - improvements to the run pyana / quit pyana interface. 
	  - bugfix in pyana_image_beta (cspad)
	
2011-Oct-11 ofte  Tag: V00-01-11  rev 2498 & 2499
         - minor changes in this particular revision. Main purpose is to make 
	   a new tag to make the most recent changes available in the release. 
	
2011-Oct-07 ofte                rev 2493
         - a few bugfixes   

2011-Oct-06 ofte                rev 2492
        - cleaned up cspad.py some, mainly for pixelmap development to come
	- fixed a bug with XtcPyanaControl panel, not killing widget and pyan
	  if another instance was made. If anyone considered this a positive 
	  feature, let me know.

2011-Oct-03 ofte                rev 2440
	- only updated the geometry description this time. More & corrected info. 
	
2011-Sep-30 ofte                rev 2439
        - changed the naming scheme for the cspad calibration data files. Now 
	it is ready to implement some parameter to point to experiment's own calibration files. 

2011-Sep-30 ofte                rev 2436
	- added a function to utilities for making the interactive plot in e.g. ipython
	  (plot_image())
2011-Sep-29 ofte                rev 2435
         - small changes, plus ability to use cspad.py to load a numpy array in ipython
	   and display it with matplotlib. Todo: use utilitiles to make the plot. 
	
2011-Sep-26 ofte                rev 2434
         - more improvements to new approach. Also more info gathered by XtcScanner. 

2011-Sep-26 ofte                rev 2433
        - improvements to xtcexplorernew: acqiris 1/2way implemented, not connected. 
	- improved connections between guis

2011-Sep-26 ofte                rev 2429
        - Several small changes
	- To speed up waveforms, I have opted not to display errorbars. Huge difference!!

2011-Sep-26 ofte                rev 2428
        - Added some of the GUI look and feel from xtcexplorernew to the old, 
	 since the new explorer seems might need some more work to finish... if 
	 at all worthwile... ? 
	- Old now has the new file selector, and multiprocessing. 
	
2011-Sep-23 ofte                rev 2425
        - Change the way Plotter and Frames are handled to fix a problem 
	  with colorbar being disconnected when endjob plot appars. In fact 
	  this should handle another problem with memory leak too (too many 
	  "frames" stored)
	- pyana_cspad.py and pyana_image.py changed accordingly. 
	- cspad.py: added functionality to draw a picture from array file 
	  independent of pyana / xtcexplorer. That part isn't properly working 
	  yet, but shouldn't break anything either. More next week... 
	
2011-Sep-22 ofte                rev 2424
        - fixed middle-button reset for cspad&images (utilities.py)

2011-Sep-21 ofte                rev 2419
        - pyana_cspad.py now has the option of saving and background subtract 
	  using a pixel array file of same dimensions as the pedestals file used
	  in psana
	
2011-Sep-20 ofte                rev 2412
        - solved the cspad pixel array problem, still lacks the ability to save it. 
	- improved the axes labeling (ticks) for projection plots of cspad. 

2011-Sep-19 ofte                rev 2411
        - included gaps and margins for full Cspad detector view. Now uses 
	  all the same calibration files as psana uses (potentially at least)

2011-Sep-19 ofte                rev 2410
        - removed pixel save from cspad to "solve" a problem	

2011-Sep-19 ofte                rev 2409
	- save max 100 (parameter) single-shot events (cspad and image (old))
	
2011-Sep-16 ofte                rev 2404
        - minor modifications
	
2011-Sep-16 ofte                rev 2401
	- pyana_image_beta and pyana_plotter_beta added
	- minor changes to new GUI
	
2011-Sep-15 ofte                 rev 2400
	- pyana_cspad.py: small improvements / crash fixes. 
	- utilities.py: Simplification of Data containers
	- pyana_ipimb.py and XtcPyanaControl.py: 'variables' -> 'quantities'
	- additionally, I've added the following modules that allow to run 
	  the new version of the GUI. Not ready yet, but I'd like to get it 
	  into svn anyhow. It can be run with xtcexplorernew and should be 
	  independent of the old one (new classes and new modules) and its 
	  development *should not* break the old xtcexplorer... 
          A       XtcExplorer/app/xtcexplorernew
	  A       XtcExplorer/src/config_pyana.py
	  A       XtcExplorer/src/gui_explorer_main.py
	  A       XtcExplorer/src/gui_config_panels.py

          Tag
	
2011-Jun-22 ofte                   rev 2026
        - fixed a bug in pyana_image (for Princeton)
	- fixed a bug in pyana_encoder (now -1 entries for unvalid entries, needed for time line plot)
	- pyana_image now uses Threshold class instead of the home-made double threshold. 
	- FIXME! pyana_image: There's still a problem when number of plots change from 
	  event to event (e.g. one image passes threshold while the other doesnt). For now, solved
	  by plotting each time anyway, changing title (bright or dark) depending on over/under threshold.

	- pyana_ipimb: variable list to select what to plot
	- pyana_plotter: avoid drawing every event (slows things down). 
	   Relies on event 'show_event'. Added flag putting to all modules. 
	- pyana_cspad displays average so far, if no darks. To do: accumulate/reset
	
2011-Jun-15 ofte                   rev 1986

	- Supports background subtraction, both from dark file and on-the-fly dark average
	- Supports saving good average and dark average as numpy file. 
	- Supports saving good single-events to file (numpy)
	
2011-Jun-09 ofte                  rev 1964
        - Cleaned up utilities, cspad and image modules somewhat more. 
	- The projections now reflect the (interactive) change of vmin/vmax
	- Allow filtering / skipping events / not running modules downstream 
	  if this shot is not passing threshold (using evt.put(True,'skip_event'))	
	
2011-Jun-08 ofte                  rev 1961
	- Several structural changes to utilities.py and some to 
	  pyana_image and pyana_cspad. Attempt at better organization 
	  and similarity of the two modules. Some additional features 
	  and probably bugs too. Will clean this up further in the coming
	  days. Frame object to hold threshold and other information from 
	  each plot, instead of the Plotter object which contains all plots 
	  (Frames) in one figure canvas.

2011-May-6 ofte               rev 1835
        XtcPyanaControl.py
	- Experimented with threading / subprocesses, but all is restored back I hope. 
	- More GUI control for general settings (display mode, plotting frequency etc, ipython)
	XtcBrowserMain.py
	- added nevents to the transferred info from xtcscanner
	pyana_ipimb.py
	- Changed the plot layout a bit
	pyana_bld.py
	- Added support for the SharedIpimb
	pyana_image.py
	- cleaned up endjob some
	pyana_scan.py
	- experimented with ipython, but restored. 
	- support for shared ipimb included
	pyana_waveform.py
	- More sensible tracking of average waveform
	- removed the non-functioning const threshold routine
	pyana_plotter.py
	- ipython functionality is moved here, although here it doesn't actually work. 
	  Will add a way to get to the "stored" interactive data from this module which 
	  is run last. 
	pyana_cspad.py
	- vrange now separated by comma. 
	- Don't automatically start in interactive mode. Respect the GUI settings. 
	xbplotter.py
	- For drawframe (used by cspad and image), add projection plots	
	
2011-Apr-8 ofte V00-00-18     rev 1792
        - Some tuning. This goes with another version of the confluence documentation. 
	- waveforms still not working. 
	- ipimb filtering / scan should be improved. 

2011-Apr-8 ofte               rev 1786
        - XtcEventBrowser/src/pyana_xppscan.py: fixed some mistake.
	  IPMdiagnostics and IPMfilt utilities done, still some more plotting needed

2011-Apr-7 ofte               rev 1784
        - Almost done implementing the xpp IPMdiagnostics functionality. 
	
2011-Apr-6 ofte               rev 1770
	- added XtcEventBrowser/src/pyana_xppscan.py as a testing module 
	  for adding XPP matlab functionality. Will add to pyana_scan whatever 
	  works well / seems general enough. 
	- XtcPyanaControl now has the (hardcoded, default False) option of 
	  running pyana in a separate *thread*. Need to launch mpl figures from 
	  the GUI, not fully implemented yet, but might be in the future. Could allow
	  for more interactive data manipulation with ipython. For now, 
	  running as separate process is more convenient (currently default). 

2011-Apr-4 ofte               rev 1764
	- Some more plotting for pyana_scan (motor scan)

2011-Apr-1 ofte               rev 1763
	- Remember pyana command line from one run to the next
	- scan wrt control variables by pyana_scan.py. If ControlPV is selected, 
	  a scan will be configured (i.e. no other pyana modules). Else, as before. 
	- pyana_scan still needs some work to be fully functional
