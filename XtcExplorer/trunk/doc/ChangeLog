        Deleting       XtcExplorer/src/XtcBrowserMain.py
	Adding         XtcExplorer/src/XtcExplorerMain.py

2011-May-9 ofte               rev 1857
        Changed the name of the package to XtcExplorer (was XtcEventBrowser)

	
2011-May-6 ofte               rev 1835
        XtcPyanaControl.py
	- Experimented with threading / subprocesses, but all is restored back I hope. 
	- More GUI control for general settings (display mode, plotting frequency etc, ipython)
	XtcBrowserMain.py
	- added nevents to the transferred info from xtcscanner
	pyana_ipimb.py
	- Changed the plot layout a bit
	pyana_bld.py
	- Added support for the SharedIpimb
	pyana_image.py
	- cleaned up endjob some
	pyana_scan.py
	- experimented with ipython, but restored. 
	- support for shared ipimb included
	pyana_waveform.py
	- More sensible tracking of average waveform
	- removed the non-functioning const threshold routine
	pyana_plotter.py
	- ipython functionality is moved here, although here it doesn't actually work. 
	  Will add a way to get to the "stored" interactive data from this module which 
	  is run last. 
	pyana_cspad.py
	- vrange now separated by comma. 
	- Don't automatically start in interactive mode. Respect the GUI settings. 
	xbplotter.py
	- For drawframe (used by cspad and image), add projection plots	
	
2011-Apr-8 ofte V00-00-18     rev 1792
        - Some tuning. This goes with another version of the confluence documentation. 
	- waveforms still not working. 
	- ipimb filtering / scan should be improved. 

2011-Apr-8 ofte               rev 1786
        - XtcEventBrowser/src/pyana_xppscan.py: fixed some mistake.
	  IPMdiagnostics and IPMfilt utilities done, still some more plotting needed

2011-Apr-7 ofte               rev 1784
        - Almost done implementing the xpp IPMdiagnostics functionality. 
	
2011-Apr-6 ofte               rev 1770
	- added XtcEventBrowser/src/pyana_xppscan.py as a testing module 
	  for adding XPP matlab functionality. Will add to pyana_scan whatever 
	  works well / seems general enough. 
	- XtcPyanaControl now has the (hardcoded, default False) option of 
	  running pyana in a separate *thread*. Need to launch mpl figures from 
	  the GUI, not fully implemented yet, but might be in the future. Could allow
	  for more interactive data manipulation with ipython. For now, 
	  running as separate process is more convenient (currently default). 

2011-Apr-4 ofte               rev 1764
	- Some more plotting for pyana_scan (motor scan)

2011-Apr-1 ofte               rev 1763
	- Remember pyana command line from one run to the next
	- scan wrt control variables by pyana_scan.py. If ControlPV is selected, 
	  a scan will be configured (i.e. no other pyana modules). Else, as before. 
	- pyana_scan still needs some work to be fully functional
	
2011-Mar-31 ofte               rev 1723

        - Display mode: Interactive (plt.show()) or SlideShow(plt.draw()) or None
	- This version needs pyana V00-00-24 or later (use evt.put and evt.get)
