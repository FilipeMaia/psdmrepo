 *	This interface defines the PeakDetect class, which implements
 *	peak detection for C-arrays. It relies on the Point and PointVector
 *  classes, whose interfaces are also included, that are simple classes
 *  that combines the coordinates of a point into a single object and
 *  implements a dynamic array of points made of integers, respectively.
 *  The Point and PointVector classes are adapted from lecture notes of
 *  the course CS106B at Stanford University.
