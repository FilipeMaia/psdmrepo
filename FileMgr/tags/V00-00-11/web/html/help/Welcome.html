          This application provides an access to data catalogs of LCLS experiments.
          The catalogs are managed by the OFFLINE Data Management System of LCLS. An actual
          implementation of the software is based on the iRODS File Manager. The application
          provides two views onto the catalogs: based on LCLS instruments and experiments, and
          based on the low-level catalog tree of iRODS. Most users will probably more
          interested in the former view.

          section of the top-level menu. You can also submit bug reports, suggestions
          using the built-in <b>Help</b>.</p>
