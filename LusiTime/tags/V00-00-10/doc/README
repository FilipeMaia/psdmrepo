Time class
==========

The Time class defined in this package provides time operations with 
nanosecond precision. The class stores time as number of seconds since 
1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC (regular UNIX time) plus a number of nanoseconds 
(normalized, never larger than 999999999). The class can also represent 
"invalid" time which may be returned as an error from some operations. 
Regular applications should not be operating on invalid time values, so 
many methods throw an exceptions when they encounter invalid time 
values.

Time class defines several methods for construction of the time objects 
and accessing the values of the seconds and nanoseconds fields. 
Additionally several free methods are defined for comparison between 
time values and for printing. 

Constructors
------------

Default constructor for Time class produces "invalid" time object which 
cannot be used for any reasonable operations, but only on the left side 
of assignment operator.

Main constructor for the class is the one which takes two arguments - 
seconds and nanoseconds. This constructor should not be used directly by 
the client code, clients instead should use various static factory 
methods.

Factory methods
---------------

Static method Time::now() returns current system time. On some platforms 
the resolution of the system clock can be lower than single nanosecond.

Static method Time::parse(std::string) converts string in external time 
format into time object. See section below on supported time formats.

Static method Time::from64(long long unsigned) converts a 64-bit number
into time object. The number is expected to be produced by an opposite
static method Time::to64(Time). The packed numbers are meant to be used
in various contexts, including databases.

Methods
-------

Method Time::sec() returns number of seconds as time_t value. For 
invalid time it can return anything.

Method Time::nsec() return number of nanoseconds as long value. For 
invalid times returned value will be negative.

Method Time::isValid() returns true for valid time object and false for 
invalid objects.

Method toString() returns time formatted according to some predefined 
format ("%F %T%f%z"). Method toString(std::string) returns time 
formatted according to user-supplied format string.

Time formats
------------

The method Time::parse() accepts few possible date/time formats. 
Simplest format is a single-word string which starts with the capital S 
followed by the decimal value of the seconds filed and optionally by the 
decimal point and a fraction of the second. This looks very much like 
the regular fixed point number with one exception: if the decimal point 
is specified there has to be at least one digit following it. Here are 
few examples and their corresponding values (seconds and nanoseconds):

  "S0"                         = Time(0,0)
  "S1000"                      = Time(1000,0)
  "S1000.1"                    = Time(1000,100000000)
  "S1000.123456789"            = Time(1000,123456789)

Second more familiar time format is a subset of the ISO8601 with few 
extensions. Its general format is:

- 4-digit year optionally followed by two-digit month optionally 
  followed by two-digit day of month. Year, month and day can be separated 
  by a dash character (-).
- Date/time separator which can consist of either single 'T' character 
  or multiple spaces. Separator is only required when there is a time or 
  timezone following the date part.
- Optional time consisting of 1- or 2-digits hour, optional 2-digit 
  minutes, optional 2-digits seconds, and optional decimal point and 
  fractional seconds part. Hours, minutes and seconds can be separated by 
  a colon character (:).
- Optional timezone offset which can be either a single character 'Z' 
  denoting zero UTC offset, or plus or minus sign with 2-digit hours and 
  optional two-digit minutes. Hours and minutes can be separated by colon.
- If timezone part is missing then the time is assumed to be in the local 
  time zone. 

Here are few examples of the time specification using this syntax, all 
examples refer to the same time (January 1, 2001, 00:00:00 UTC)

  "2001Z"
  "2001-01Z"
  "2001-01-01Z"
  "2001-01-01+00"
  "2001-01-01 00"
  "2001-01-01T00:00"
  "2001-01-01 00:00:00-00:00"
  "2001-01-01 02:00+02"
  "2001-01-01 02:00:00.000+02"
  "2000-12-31 16:00:00.000-0800"
  "20001231T160000-08"

Output time format produced by toString() function is controlled by the 
format string which uses strftime(3) control sequences with one 
additional sequence for controlling output of nanoseconds. The new 
sequence is "%.<N>f" where <N> is a number between 1 and 9. The sequence 
outputs a decimal dot followed but the fractional second part with the 
precision determined by <N> parameter. The "%f" control sequence is a 
shorthand for "%.9f". All other control characters are passed directly 
to strftime(3) for formatting. DEfault format string used by toString() 
is "%F %T%f%z".

Here is the example of the output produced by different control strings 
assuming following code runs in UTC time zone:

  Time t( 0, 123456789 ) ;
  cout << t.toString(fmt) ;

  fmt                   Result 
  ---------------------------------
  "%Y-%m-%d"            1970-01-01
  "%F"                  1970-01-01
  "%H:%M:%S"            00:00:00
  "%T%z"                00:00:00-0000
  "%T%f%z"              00:00:00.123456789-0000
  "%T%.3f%z"            00:00:00.123-0000
  "%F %T%f%z"           1970-01-01 00:00:00.123456789-0000

For better portability one should always add %z control for the output 
format or use the default format.
