Tag: V00-25-00
2013-01-24 Andy Salnikov
- implementaion of the aligned datasets by adding zero-filled missing
  contribution for damaged data objects
- the whole thing is still driven by the content of datagrams, so 
  there is still no strong guarantee that all datasets in the same 
  calibcycle will be aligned, for badly messed-up data we can't 
  correct everything

Tag: V00-24-00
2013-01-23 Andy Salnikov
- significant refactoring of the converter infrastructure:
  https://pswww.slac.stanford.edu/trac/psdm/ticket/186#comment:5

- implemented special event-type converter for acqiris config data
  needsd for storting BDL acqiris data types

Tag: V00-22-00
2013-01-10 Andy Salnikov
- implement splitting of the shared BLD data types
- O2OCvtFactory now instantiates event-type converters for all config types,
  these converters are only active when data comes from BLD; config-type
  converters for the same types only accept data coming from non-BLD sources.
- O2OHdf5Writer::dataObject now checks for shared BLD types and splits them 
  into their components.
- ConfigDataTypeCvt and EvtDataTypeCvtDef now take optional arguments of new 
  type SrcFilter which defines types of data sources to accept or reject

Tag: V00-21-02
2013-01-02 Andy Salnikov
- upgrading to pdsdata V05-03-00

- added specialized converter for BldDataPimV1

Tag: V00-21-00
2012-11-27 Andy Salnikov
- another refactoring - everything related to time dataset now happens 
  in a base converter class EvtDataTypeCvt, subclasses don't need to 
  deal with time any more (but epics is always a special case).

Tag: V00-20-00
2012-11-21 Andy Salnikov
- provision for schema numbers and optional features in HDF5 files
  implemented as attributes of the file

- when acqiris object segments and samples differ from configuration
  produce error message but do not kill translation

2012-07-20 Andy Salnikov
- implemented scan-based splitting of output files
- --split-mode=family renamed to --split-mode=size
- ConfigObjectStore implementation changed to accept multiple objects 
  with the same Src, it uses multimap internally; in addition data is 
  stored as vector<char> instead of char* so we know the size of the data
- converters map is now fully encapsulated inside O2OCvtFactory class

Tag: V00-18-11
2012-07-18 Andy Salnikov
- when renaming files check existing file names, if present then do not
  rename and print error message (maybe need to throw an exception instead)

Tag: V00-18-10
2012-07-18 Andy Salnikov
- next step in scan-based splitting, implement moving (renaming) of the
  produced HDF5 files in translator itself, right after any HDF5 is closed.

Tag: andy-20120717

- I think there was a bug in Princeton.FrameV1 converter, it did not take 
  into account pixel binning, should be fixed now

Tag: V00-18-01
2012-05-03 Andy Salnikov
- add protection for non-unique alias names

Tag: V00-18-00
2012-05-01 Andy Salnikov
- adding support for EPICS aliases
- datagrams from Configure and BeginCalibCycle contain both config
  objects and regular data objects (EPICS config and EPICS data),
  to process data objects one needs to have config object ready,
  so for these two transitions we do double scan now, once for 
  config objects, second time for data objects
- O2OXtcScannerI has new method configObject() which is called on 
  the first scan, existing method dataObject() is called on second 
  scan.
- O2OXtcIterator gets optional parameter in ctor, iif set to true 
  then it calls scanner::configObject() otherwise scanner::dataObject()
- O2OHdf5Writer::dataObject() implementation is now split between two 
  above methods
- EpicsDataTypeCvt now creates soft links for aliases pointing to the 
  original PV groups.

  DroppedContribution but in reality did not do anything, test for
  DroppedContribution is not really needed.

Tag: V00-17-03
2012-03-07 Andy Salnikov
- Timepix::DataV1 is converted to DavaV2 which has image data correctly 
  re-arranged and saved as "Timepix::DataV2"

Tag: V00-17-00
2012-02-08 Andy Salnikov
- renamed CsPadMiniCalibV1Cvt to CsPad2x2CalibV1Cvt
- 2x2 calibration now come from 'CsPad2x2::CalibV1' directory and
  stored in HDF5 file in a group with the same name
- 2x2 calibrations are read when either CsPad2x2::ConfigV1 or
  CsPad::ConfigV3 are present in XTC file

Tag: V00-16-00
2012-02-06 Andy Salnikov
- upgrading to pdsdata V03-02-11

- adding translation for new Timepix classes

Tag: V00-15-01
2011-12-14 Andy Salnikov
- add support for cspad.ConfigV3 and cspad.ElementV1 combination

Tag: V00-15-00
2011-12-10 Andy Salnikov
- migrating cspad calibration to ndarray use

Tag: V00-14-04
2011-12-08 Andy Salnikov

2011-10-12 Andy Salnikov
- removed all SciMD-related code, it was never used and only  
  introduced dependency on odbc

Tag: V00-13-00
2011-10-05 Andy Salnikov
- committing proper fix for multi-source EPICS, now identification
  is based on the PV names instead of IDs. Multiple instances 
  with the same name will all end up in the same container.
- Not clear how this fix will work with the proposed fix to
  XTC data when there are multiple devices, I suspect that it
  should work OK but this needs checking.

Tag: V00-12-07
2011-10-05 Andy Salnikov
- continuing EPICS saga, improved handling of the multi-source
  data. Data with the same address which appeared to come from
  different sources were not handled correctly. Changing 
  CvtGroupMap::_SrcCmp::operator() to ignore host IP in Pds::Src,
  so that source address compares correctly even though the
  host IP is different.

Tag: V00-12-06
2011-10-04 Andy Salnikov
- PSCalib::CalibFileFinder interface changed, updating code here
- type of cspad image changed to signed and lots of code expects 
  int16_t now, so we change types in few places here

Tag: V00-12-05
2011-10-03 Andy Salnikov
- add protection for creation of new groups when group exists already,
  this is necessary workaround for "multisource" epics.

Tag: V00-12-04
2011-10-03 Andy Salnikov
- fix for wrong sign of common mode in CsPadMiniElementV1Cvt

Tag: V00-12-03
2011-09-17 Andy Salnikov
- event time was only recorded correctly for L1Accept, objects 
  stored in Configure received incorrect timestamps

Tag: V00-12-02
2011-09-13 Andy Salnikov
- bug fix in CsPadMiniElementV1Cvt, only half of the image was copied

Tag: V00-12-01
2011-09-11 Andy Salnikov
- in CsPad converters inlined rounding of doubles to improve performance

Tag: V00-12-00
2011-09-07 Andy Salnikov
- enabling shuffle compression for many datasets, this should 
  improve zlib compression slightly without much CPU time increase

  use their corresponding source names.
- for ControlData (Control level) the group name changed to "Control"
- updated o2o-scanner to print correct source names

Tag: V00-10-11
2011-06-28 Andy Salnikov

  XtcInput::Dgram class which contains smart pointer and file name.

Tag: V00-10-05
2011-03-20 Andy Salnikov
- use smart pointer for datagram class

Tag: V00-10-04
2011-03-08 Andy Salnikov
- bug fix in CameraFrameV1, image dimensions were swapped
- to mark the data with the correct dimensions we add new empty dataset 
  to the CameraFrameV1 group with the name "_dim_fix_flag_201103",
  presence of this dataset means that dimensions are fixed

Tag: V00-10-03

2010-09-01 Andy Salnikov
- first attempt to handle split events, results are far from perfect yet
  but usable for some limited value of usable
- O2OXtcMerger does not actually merge anyhting, it simply returs all
  datagrams to caller trying to arrange them in time order
- O2OHdfWriter handles all remaining issues, it filters duplicate 
  control datagrams and filters out L1Accept histograms that have 
  unusual time stamps

Tag: V00-07-08
2010-08-31 Andy Salnikov
- O2OHdf5Writer - use file creation property list to change the sizes
  of the b-rtrees in a file, this should reduce overhead that we see 
  for XPP data

Tag: V00-07-07
2010-08-26 Andy Salnikov
- O2OXtcMerger now changes datagram clock time
- l1OffsetSec is now double so can have sub-second precision
- o2o-scanner has --l1-offset option too

Tag: V00-07-06
2010-08-12 Andy Salnikov

  led to sync troubles in some rare cases, now disabling all Disable

Tag: V00-07-05
2010-08-11 Andy Salnikov
- updating for pdsdata V02-06-00

Tag: V00-07-04
2010-06-09 Andy Salnikov

- forgot to add PnCCDFrameV1Cvt to svn

Tag: V00-05-00
2009-11-24 Andy Salnikov
- small refactoring:
  - removed CvtDataContFactoryImage class (not used, will need more
    generic way to assign attributes to datasets)
  - removed CvtDataContFactoryAcqirisV1 class (CvtDataContFactoryTyped
    is used instead)
  - removed CvtDataContFactoryFrameV1 class (CvtDataContFactoryTyped
    is used instead)
  - CvtDataContFactoryTyped now uses type that is passed as extra 
    parameter to container() method
- new converter class PnCCDFrameV1Cvt for Pds::PNCCD::FrameV1, this is
  a special converter that needs both Config object and Event object
- two new types supported by O2OHdf5Writer: Pds::PNCCD::ConfigV1 and
  Pds::PNCCD::FrameV1 (not tested yet)
