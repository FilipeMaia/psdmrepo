- add protection for non-unique alias names

Tag: V00-18-00
2012-05-01 Andy Salnikov
- adding support for EPICS aliases
- datagrams from Configure and BeginCalibCycle contain both config
  objects and regular data objects (EPICS config and EPICS data),
  to process data objects one needs to have config object ready,
  so for these two transitions we do double scan now, once for 
  config objects, second time for data objects
- O2OXtcScannerI has new method configObject() which is called on 
  the first scan, existing method dataObject() is called on second 
  scan.
- O2OXtcIterator gets optional parameter in ctor, iif set to true 
  then it calls scanner::configObject() otherwise scanner::dataObject()
- O2OHdf5Writer::dataObject() implementation is now split between two 
  above methods
- EpicsDataTypeCvt now creates soft links for aliases pointing to the 
  original PV groups.

Tag: V00-17-04
2012-03-08 Andy Salnikov

  DroppedContribution but in reality did not do anything, test for
  DroppedContribution is not really needed.

Tag: V00-17-03
2012-03-07 Andy Salnikov
- Timepix::DataV1 is converted to DavaV2 which has image data correctly 
  re-arranged and saved as "Timepix::DataV2"

- updated ChangeLog

Tag: V00-17-01
2012-02-08 Andy Salnikov
- small fix, not everything was changed to 2x2 in last commit

Tag: V00-17-00
2012-02-08 Andy Salnikov
- renamed CsPadMiniCalibV1Cvt to CsPad2x2CalibV1Cvt
- 2x2 calibration now come from 'CsPad2x2::CalibV1' directory and
  stored in HDF5 file in a group with the same name
- 2x2 calibrations are read when either CsPad2x2::ConfigV1 or
  CsPad::ConfigV3 are present in XTC file

Tag: V00-16-00
2012-02-06 Andy Salnikov
- upgrading to pdsdata V03-02-11
- renamed CsPadMiniElementV1Cvt to CsPad2x2ElementV1Cvt
- use CsPad2x2::ElementV1 instead of CsPad::MiniElementV1 (also
  changed group name).
- added conversion for CsPad2x2::ConfigV1

Tag: V00-15-02
2012-01-12 Andy Salnikov
- adding translation for new Timepix classes

Tag: V00-15-01
2011-12-14 Andy Salnikov
- add support for cspad.ConfigV3 and cspad.ElementV1 combination

Tag: V00-15-00
2011-12-10 Andy Salnikov
- migrating cspad calibration to ndarray use

Tag: V00-14-04
2011-12-08 Andy Salnikov
- increasing chunk size for large dataset, should help with the
  performance when opening large files

Tag: V00-14-03
2011-11-11 Andy Salnikov
- adding support for Encoder::ConfigV2, Gsc16ai::ConfigV1
  and Gsc16ai::DataV1 classes

Tag: V00-14-02
2011-11-07 Andy Salnikov
- added application for filtering XTC files

Tag: V00-14-01
2011-10-12 Andy Salnikov
- make cspad 2x2 calibration to use the same calibration directory
  as regular cspad

Tag: V00-14-00
2011-10-12 Andy Salnikov
- removed all SciMD-related code, it was never used and only  
  introduced dependency on odbc

Tag: V00-13-00
2011-10-05 Andy Salnikov
- committing proper fix for multi-source EPICS, now identification
  is based on the PV names instead of IDs. Multiple instances 
  with the same name will all end up in the same container.
- Not clear how this fix will work with the proposed fix to
  XTC data when there are multiple devices, I suspect that it
  should work OK but this needs checking.

Tag: V00-12-07
2011-10-05 Andy Salnikov
- continuing EPICS saga, improved handling of the multi-source
  data. Data with the same address which appeared to come from
  different sources were not handled correctly. Changing 
  CvtGroupMap::_SrcCmp::operator() to ignore host IP in Pds::Src,
  so that source address compares correctly even though the
  host IP is different.

Tag: V00-12-06
2011-10-04 Andy Salnikov
- PSCalib::CalibFileFinder interface changed, updating code here
- type of cspad image changed to signed and lots of code expects 
  int16_t now, so we change types in few places here

Tag: V00-12-05
2011-10-03 Andy Salnikov
- add protection for creation of new groups when group exists already,
  this is necessary workaround for "multisource" epics.

Tag: V00-12-04
2011-10-03 Andy Salnikov
- fix for wrong sign of common mode in CsPadMiniElementV1Cvt

Tag: V00-12-03
2011-09-17 Andy Salnikov
- event time was only recorded correctly for L1Accept, objects 
  stored in Configure received incorrect timestamps

Tag: V00-12-02
2011-09-13 Andy Salnikov
- bug fix in CsPadMiniElementV1Cvt, only half of the image was copied

Tag: V00-12-01
2011-09-11 Andy Salnikov
- in CsPad converters inlined rounding of doubles to improve performance

Tag: V00-12-00
2011-09-07 Andy Salnikov
- enabling shuffle compression for many datasets, this should 
  improve zlib compression slightly without much CPU time increase

Tag: V00-11-03

  converter objects for both data and calibrations

2011-03-20 Andy Salnikov
- use smart pointer for datagram class

Tag: V00-10-04
2011-03-08 Andy Salnikov
- bug fix in CameraFrameV1, image dimensions were swapped
- to mark the data with the correct dimensions we add new empty dataset 
  to the CameraFrameV1 group with the name "_dim_fix_flag_201103",
  presence of this dataset means that dimensions are fixed

2010-09-01 Andy Salnikov
- first attempt to handle split events, results are far from perfect yet
  but usable for some limited value of usable
- O2OXtcMerger does not actually merge anyhting, it simply returs all
  datagrams to caller trying to arrange them in time order
- O2OHdfWriter handles all remaining issues, it filters duplicate 
  control datagrams and filters out L1Accept histograms that have 
  unusual time stamps

Tag: V00-07-08
2010-08-31 Andy Salnikov
- O2OHdf5Writer - use file creation property list to change the sizes

2010-08-11 Andy Salnikov
- updating for pdsdata V02-06-00

Tag: V00-07-04

  is none

  - removed CvtDataContFactoryAcqirisV1 class (CvtDataContFactoryTyped
    is used instead)

    is used instead)
  - CvtDataContFactoryTyped now uses type that is passed as extra 
    parameter to container() method
- new converter class PnCCDFrameV1Cvt for Pds::PNCCD::FrameV1, this is
  a special converter that needs both Config object and Event object
- two new types supported by O2OHdf5Writer: Pds::PNCCD::ConfigV1 and
  Pds::PNCCD::FrameV1 (not tested yet)
