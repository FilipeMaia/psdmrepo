- forgot to add CsPad V2 converters to O2OHdf5Writer

Tag: V00-08-02
2010-10-01 Andy Salnikov
- update for pdsdata V02-08-00
- new class CsPadElementV2Cvt
- layout of CspadElementV1 has changed, CsPadElementV1Cvt
  is reimplemented for new layout

Tag: V00-08-01
2010-09-03 Andy Salnikov
- update for pdsdata V02-07-00
- implementing cspad conversion

Tag: V00-08-00
2010-09-01 Andy Salnikov
- first attempt to handle split events, results are far from perfect yet
  but usable for some limited value of usable
- O2OXtcMerger does not actually merge anyhting, it simply returs all
  datagrams to caller trying to arrange them in time order
- O2OHdfWriter handles all remaining issues, it filters duplicate 
  control datagrams and filters out L1Accept histograms that have 
  unusual time stamps

Tag: V00-07-08
2010-08-31 Andy Salnikov
- O2OHdf5Writer - use file creation property list to change the sizes
  of the b-rtrees in a file, this should reduce overhead that we see 
  for XPP data

Tag: V00-07-07
2010-08-26 Andy Salnikov
- O2OXtcMerger now changes datagram clock time
- l1OffsetSec is now double so can have sub-second precision
- o2o-scanner has --l1-offset option too

Tag: V00-07-06
2010-08-12 Andy Salnikov
- not all Disable transitions were disabled (tag V00-07-04) which again
  led to sync troubles in some rare cases, now disabling all Disable

Tag: V00-07-05
2010-08-11 Andy Salnikov
- updating for pdsdata V02-06-00

Tag: V00-07-04
2010-06-09 Andy Salnikov
- fixing stream sync proble for some types of problems, Disable 
  transition order in XTC file can be "random". For now throw away 
  all Disable transitions in the stream merge algorithm
- relax filtering of damaged data, make it identical to pyana 

Tag: V00-07-03
2010-06-08 Andy Salnikov
- updating for pdsdata V02-04-00

Tag: V00-07-02
2010-06-08 Andy Salnikov
- updating for XPP and pdsdata V02-02-00
- added protection against zero-size payload to ConfigDataTypeCvt, there
  are some weird XTCs in commissioning XPP data
- EvrDataV3Cvt does not need config object at all

Tag: V00-07-01
2010-05-12 Andy Salnikov
- replaced Lusi/Lusi.h with SITConfig/SITConfig.h

Tag: V00-07-00
2010-05-12 Andy Salnikov
- small-scale refactoring, extracted the code that handles configuration
  object store into separate class, now event data converters use one 
  instance of this store to find their configurations
- adopt to pdsdata V02-00-01, few new types added
- o2o-translator: default file extension is now h5, default split mode
  is none

Tag: V00-06-04
2010-03-24 Andy Salnikov
- change in the options for o2o-translator:
  -e option disappears
  -f option disappears, files are now specified as positional arguments

Tag: V00-06-03
2010-03-24 Andy Salnikov
- bug fix in AcqirisDataDescV1Cvt, waveform type should have been 
  signed

Tag: V00-06-02
2010-02-02 Andy Salnikov
- O2OXtcDgIterator: bug fix, in the case when payload size is zero
  it produces an error because fread returns 0 for zero-sized object

Tag: V00-06-01
2009-12-17 Andy Salnikov
- add new class O2OXtcDgIterator which is a repalcement for 
  XtcfileIterator with correct error handling

Tag: V00-06-00
2009-12-10 Andy Salnikov
- New interface to scimd needs additional connection string for RegDB

Tag: V00-05-03
2009-12-04 Andy Salnikov
- add option --l1-offset to translator to correct the timestamps for 
  amo00409 runs 39-146

Tag: V00-05-02
2009-11-30 Andy Salnikov
- enable damaged events in o2o-scanner, O2OXtcDechunk is now passed
  a boolean flag that enables/disables damaged filter
- o2o-scanner is now a standard AppUtil application, easier to add options
- increased datagram buffer size in o2o-scanner

Tag: V00-05-01
2009-11-24 Andy Salnikov
- forgot to add PnCCDFrameV1Cvt to svn

Tag: V00-05-00
2009-11-24 Andy Salnikov
- small refactoring:
  - removed CvtDataContFactoryImage class (not used, will need more
    generic way to assign attributes to datasets)
  - removed CvtDataContFactoryAcqirisV1 class (CvtDataContFactoryTyped
    is used instead)
  - removed CvtDataContFactoryFrameV1 class (CvtDataContFactoryTyped
    is used instead)
  - CvtDataContFactoryTyped now uses type that is passed as extra 
    parameter to container() method
- new converter class PnCCDFrameV1Cvt for Pds::PNCCD::FrameV1, this is
  a special converter that needs both Config object and Event object
- two new types supported by O2OHdf5Writer: Pds::PNCCD::ConfigV1 and
  Pds::PNCCD::FrameV1 (not tested yet)
  
Tag: V00-04-05
