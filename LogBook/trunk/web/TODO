- migrate to use Registry for information about experiments one the one will
  be available.

- write Python API for a subset of operations (start/stop run, set/update a value
of a run parameter).

- think about how to implement the "search_entry(parameters...)" operations
in a way which would be not depending on using MySQL SQL directly in
parameters of the method. Think about setting limits on parameters, for
example.

- design the "Search Form". Discuss it with Rahul.
