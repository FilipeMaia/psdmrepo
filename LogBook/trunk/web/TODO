- finish READ-ONLY interfaces for free-form entries

- extend the API to allow adding/updating objects (experiments, runs, etc.). For runs
introduce two separate methods: start_run(timestamp) and stop_run(timestamp). If no
stop_run is given (check it by NULL in the run's end_time) then the next start_run()
would stop the last run and begin the new one.

- write a very simple Web GUI for the Logbook. Pages to develop first:
  -- a form for creating a new free-form entry
  -- a tree for displaying related entries
  -- a simple form for managing runs (start/stop/inspect)
     (display the last/current run in READ color)
  -- a table for displaying run summary parameters

- write Python API for a subset of operations (start/stop run, set/update a value
of a run parameter).
