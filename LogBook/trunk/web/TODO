KNOWN PROBLEMS, BUGS

- fix the DisplayShift.php not to show 'Close Current Shift' and
  'Begin New Shift' links for non-authorized users.

- the same issue in the index.php file. Disable 'Create Shift' button
  in the top-level menu bar ('Shifts')

+ fixed a a bug in the LogBookExperiment::find_last_shift() method which wasn't usinng
  an experiment identifier to narrow down the begin time.

+ fixed a bug in the file descriptions list of the GUI apps when replying to a message.

___________________________
URGENT PROBLEMS FOR LOGBOOK

+ put a table with all available run parameters into the Run Summary page

+ display experiment-specific parameters as well

      +----------+     +---------+
- add | << Prev  | and | Next >> | buttons to the messages viewer. This should show up for the top-level messages only.
      +----------+     +---------+

      +----------------+
- add | Parent Message | for the replies.
      +----------------+

- add a possibility to change the default soft order for messages in a list. The feature
  requested by John Bozek.

- add a possibility to display message in an order they're posted, not by threads

- add a possibility to unfold new messages if requested

- add a possibility to limit 'Last 10 messages | Today | 1 day | 1 week | All history' of messages.

  IMPORTANT: This selector would only work if the normal (newest on top) order of messages is used.
  Otherwise disable the 

+ implement 'Subscribe' functionality (schema changes may be required to register non-SLAC e-mail
  addresses by users who're looged into shared accounts, or to register multiple e-mail addresses).
  Allow users to manage their subscriptions (unsubscribe/subscribe/change e-mail address/choose
  between TEXT|HTML format of e-mail messages). Each message received by a user would have a link
  at its bottom leading directly to unsubscribe operation.

EARLY FEEDBACK FROM AMEDEO (Aug 19, 2009)

- study a possibility to convert PostScript to JPEG/PNG "on the fly".
  UPDATE: This can be done by ImageMagic's 'convert' command or PHP module:
  http://pecl.php.net/package/imagick

- in order to better assist with usability problems the application may record users'
  activities and get them stored in the database. The gathered information will be
  used to analyze a sequence of actions and users' input made before a problem occured.

+ improve the PHP LDAP API at RegDB to recognize secondary groups as well.

+ fix the "crosstalk" of the 'Options' buttons in the 'New Message' anbd 'Reply' dialogs.

+ put a title to the grabber (root.title())

+ order group names alphabetically when selecting POSIX Group in the Experiment Registration Dialog

+ run Welcome.html through the spell check (typos make people crazy!)

+ have at least one entry ready in the attachments dialog when posting new messages or replies.
  Then allow people to add more (replace "Expand" with something else like "Add"). Do the same for tags.

+ shorten the path to: https://pswww/apps/logbook. Do thit before making the server
  open to the internet and advertizing its expernal URL.

+ serve LogBook as all lower-case logbook. Follow the same approach for other apps and services

      +----------+     +---------+
+ add | << First | and | Last >> | buttons to the messages viewer
      +----------+     +---------+

+ add 'Print' button to the 'Grabber', so that the operator could create a hard-copy of the
  grabbed picture. Add command line option '-p <printer command> | <printer>' to specify the desired
  destination.

+ implement proper display of subthreads (replies to messages).

+ provide a read-only version of the LogBook which wouldn't require any authentication.
  The same for RegDB.

  ATTENTION: Make sure all PHP services are properly protected before deploying it.

+ implement _partial_ editing of LogBook entries: edit the message text.

  NOTE: No backup version is the

+ Talk to Teresa on when we can get the server open. The Web & Security Committee is
  gathering this Friday (August 28, 2009) to discuss my request. Make a PPT presentation
  of the system architecture involving the Web server and Web services (for both ONLINE
  and OFFLINE "worlds").

+ add a sign to the end of the parent message subjects to indicate a presence of the subthreads:

    |
    +->

+ add a sign indicating a presence of tags - just a bold symbol 'T'

+ implement message text wrapping at 128 (using PHP wordwrap() function).

      +------------+     +------------+
- add | View Repl. | and | Hide Repl. | buttons to the messages viewer
      +------------+     +------------+

  NOTE: The viewer's bar needs to be reorganized a bit to group functions

- implement full editing LogBook entries: not just the message text, but also - renaming
  atatchments, adding more attachments to existing messages, and (perhaps) deleting atatchments,
  messages and tags.

  ATTENTION: This feature would require extending the database schema to keep a track
  of the changes made to an attachment. The simplest way would be to add shadow
  tables for: header, entry, tag and attachment.

- revisit the server and applications security (SQL injection, giving too much information in
  error reports, etc.)

- make sure the Experiment Status, Shift Status and Run Status pages are regularily
  refreshed too if the auto-refresh mode is on.

- fix a bug in the message 'Reply' to return to the same context from which the reply
  is made (right now it always goes back to the 'Experiment Status')

- add user group search (LDAP) in the experiment registry based on user name or
  his account name. This is to simplify a selection of the group.

- implement auto-refresh for new messages posted via 'Reply'. As a temporary solution,
  ass an explicit mechanism to force the refresh by an operator: 'Refresh Now' button.

  NOTE: The later would require to rearrange the buttons in the message viewer
  control bar.

- investigate increasing the 1 MB limit for attached documents. It may make a sense
  to put a little warning at the 'New Message' dialog to display the current limit.
  (Unfortunately, we can't determine the image size from JS.). Print a clear complain
  at the server side if the image size exceeds the limit.

  NOTE: Consider doing this in some clean way to avoid duplicating number.
  For example, set a value of soem JS variable when generating the PHP
  script. What should we do for the "Grabber"?

+ increase the windows size for new/edited messages

+ implement persistent links to messages.

  COMMENT: The Next/Previous navigation buttons are yet to be implemented.

- implement fixed-size priview for attached images to avoid downloading
  huge documents. This shold make LogBook more agile. The most trivial way
  to implement this would be by generating the images "on the fly".
  Most optimal way is to extend the schema for these fixed-size images
  and store the images in the extended column the first time the request
  is made. Then serve other clients from these column.

  NOTE #1: watch out for race conditions when two clients will be attempting
  to generate the same image! A solution would be to catch the exception,
  ignore it, and try reading the image. The second solution would be to
  use SQL 'UPDATE'. The best solution would be to generate the image
  when uploading the atachment. In the later case a management tool would
  be needed to geneate images for existing messages.

  NOTE #2: add a header to images to indicate that this is just a preview:

              +-----------------+
              | 800x800 preview |
   +----------+-----------------+---------+
   |               <image>                |


  NOTE #3: Leave other types of documents intact. At the moment this would
  only include PDF.


____________________________
CODE CLEANUP AND REFACTORING

- separate JS from HTML. Put JS logic into a separate file
- separate CSS from HTML and put it into a seprate file

_________
NEW IDEAS

    1. implement a persistent address for the individual messages (successAction or
    actionSuccess). That would allow expanding message trees

    2. implement a viewer for an individual message tree in a separate page (like
    Experiment status, etc.). This will be used with persistent URLs to the messages.

    3. implement the 'subscribe' mode for LogBook messages (events, to be correct), so
    that subscribed users were notified by recieving URLs pointing to new messages.
    Use LDAP to get e-mail addresses and ask a user for a confirmation. Extend
    the schema to store the subscriptions.
 
_________________________________
MEDIUM PRIORITY: unfinished tasks

+ continue discussing the security model for web apps. One idea suggested by Amedeo
  was to implement the group-based security for LogBook:

  -1. an experiment is associated with a group; the group leader automatically
  gets all admnistrative privileges for LogBook; the group members get read-write
  privileges.
  [ NOTE: This doesn't happen automatically right now. We have to register
    leaders explicitly. ]

  2. certain groups (like, lab-superusers) can be registered as administrators,
  or as just observers (top-level admins).

  -3. this should also work for netgroups (they don't seem to be retranslated into
  LDAP server of PCDS. These groups exist in NIS only.). so, the queston is how to
  access these groups from PHP?

  [ NOTE: No support for netgroups in LDAP yet. ]

  4. individual users can also be registered here for various privilege levels.

  Having said that, a proposal is to encode all of these into Andy's RolesDB
  as 'users';

    'gapon'
    'gid:xr'
    'gid:netgroup:u-whatever'

  Then it will be up to the AuthDB PHP API to take a user account and use extra
  sources of information (LDAP, and perhaps NIS?) to see if:

  a. a given user is individually registered in RoleDB, or
  b. he's associated with one or another POSIX group, and RoleDB has a record for
     that group, or
  c. ditto for the netgroups


- discuss MySQL replication with Arash Alavi to see what would be the most reliable
  protocol for switching servers in case of a failure.

- extend the LDAP PHP client implementation to support Netgroups as well
  (use the following command as an example: %ldapsearch -x cn-u-srv )

___________________________________________________
MEDIUM PRIORITY: Consider extending database schema

    1. storing both user account name and his name entered into the box when
    posting messages. If no user name is provided when entering a new message then
    use LDAP entry for the account to get its name.

    2. move tags from message header to message entries

    3. probably add some sort of the 'Shift assignment' field for shifts to be
    displayed at the 'Shift Status' page. An alternative to this would be to
    use specially tagged (SHIFT_ASSIGNMENT) messages to be automatically posted
    in a context of the shift when begining new shifts.

    NOTE: A clear 'pros' of the approach would be a possibility to search
    these assignments via the regular browsing/finding.

___________________________________________
MEDIUM PRIORITY: Improve 'New Shift' dialog

    1. in order to simplify crew formation allow using checkboxes to select
    members of the POSIX group registered with an experiment. Also allow adding
    arbitrary people (as it's done now).

      [ text ] or [ listbox ]

    The contents of the listbox will be populated by members of a POSIX group
    associated with the selected experiment. Th erequest will be sent dynamically
    using AJAX.

____________________________________________________________________________
LOW PRIORITY: Refactor the Messages Table and Dialog into a single prototype

    var ms = new  MessagesDisplay (
      element,            // HTML 'div' element where to place the display's markup
      url,                // optional URL to request messages. If not used then should be set to 'null'
      scope,              // 'experiment', 'shift', 'run' - one of these current selections
      new_message_dialog, // {true,false} - the flag requesting the dialog to be available
      auto_refresh,       // {true,false} - the flag requesting the feature to be available
      scope_selectors     // {true,false} - the flag requesting the feature to be available
    );

    NOTES: The class will be using the following global variables and markup:
    current_selection
    "workarea"

__________________________________________________
LOW PRIORITY: Imnprovements for the screen-grabber

    - allow composing a message with more than one attachment
    - add options for posting messages for the current experiment, shift or run.
    Right now it's for the selected experiment only. Use experiment status.
    - allow specifying arbitrary tags (or the preconfigured tags for the experiment)

______________________________________________________________________________
LOW PRIORITY: interesting vizualization idea: when showing a list of messages
indicate 'zones' of shifts annd runs. Zones can be shown with different colors
and indentation. Additional zone identifiers (begin time and leader of a shift
and run number) can be used as well. For example:

    <no shift - no background color>
    | + Shift: 2009-09-17 10:12:23 - leader: gapon
    |          2009-09-17 10:22:34 - by: salnikov - the test message
    |          ..
    ||  + Run: 2009-09-17 11:12:23 - number: 12
    ||         ..
    |
    ||  + Run: 2009-09-17 12:12:23 - number: 13
    ||         ..
    |
    <no shift - no background color>
    | + Shift: 2009-09-17 10:12:23 - leader: gapon

    Another possibility would be to use '+ today', '+ yesterday', '+last week', 'last month'
    to group messages similar to what's done in Outlook Express
____________________________________________________
LOW PRIORITY: more ideas on the Look And Feel design

    - Finish implementing selectors/checkboxs (experiment, shifts, runs) in 'Operator
    and Control System Messages' dialog.

    - Create curved background images for subtitles such as: 'Summary', 'Operator and
    Control System Messages', etc. Find agoo dcolor match. Defer this setting to CSS.
    Another (perhaps a beteer option) would be to use images for borders and the same
    background color for 'div'.

    - Consider 'discussion tree' option in both modes.

    - implement 'thumbs' mode for images in the 'Browse' and 'Search' modes. Each image will
    also carry a URL to the full document. HAve a button to togle the thumbs on and off.
    Where to put the one?
    One nice possibility would be to put attachments after tags. That would allow
    seeing previews as a photo-album grid. Put an empty image 'No Preview available'
    for unsupported MIME types.

      ------------------
      |                | <name>
      |                | type: jpg
      |    Thumb       | Size: 123545
      |                | [ Download ]
      |                | [ View ]

    - add 'fit page' pagination mode for 'detailed'

    - implement a support for Browser's history buttons (PREV/NEXT)

________________________________________________________________________________
LOW PRIORITY: implement "double" buffering-like behavior when navigating
between (Prev/Next) runs and shifts. The feature must be especially usefull for
runs because it would allow comparing values of run parameters.
__________________________________________________________________________
LOW PRIORITY: put something into the Help menus. Consider placing question
mark icons (suported by hyperlinks) throughout document pages.

________________________________________________________________________________
INTERESTING IDEA: In the 'Operator and Control System Messages' introduce an
option for viewing messages timestamps in the "back in time" mode. For example,
to show how many seconds/minutes/hours/days ago was the last posting. That would
give an operator some sense of timing in the automatically updated mode as well.

__________________________________________________
LOW PRIORITY: Look at the browser history support.

_______________________________________________________________
LOW PRIORITY: Implement PDF export using either FPDF or PDFlib.

URGENT: work out a solution for a request to use LogBook for various LCLC facilities

  STATUS UPDATE: As of October 21st, 2009 this has been implemented, tested
  and deployed.


  PROBLEM: LCLS also has a number of areas where people would like to use
  LogBook. Th eproblem is that those activities aren't "experiments", and they
  also aren't neccesarily related to any 'instruments'. On the other hand we'd
  like to benefit from using RegDB and AuthDB for those activities.

  PROPOSED SOLUTION:

  - keep using the same database schema ('instruments' and 'experiments') because
  a lot of code and services depend on its stability.

  - at the level of  LogBook App visually separate 'instruments' from 'locations',
  and 'experiments' from 'facilities'.

  - use the parameters of instruments in RegDB to tell application that
  a particular 'instrument' is actually a 'location'. The would allow treating
  the connected 'experiments' as 'facilities'.

  - use parameters of 'experiments' ('facilities') to control certain features of
  applications. In a context of this topic that would allow to run off 'runs'
  (and probably 'shifts') for non-experiment activities such as 'facilities'.

  IDEA:

  - consider a persistent translation table which will play a role similar
  to 'localisation'. This can be either a separate table in RegDB, with
  foreign keys from instrument/experiment tables pointing to it.
