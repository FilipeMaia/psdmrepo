- think about how to implement the "search_entry(parameters...)" operations
in a way which would be not depending on using MySQL SQL directly in
parameters of the method. Think about setting limits on parameters, for
example.

- design the "Search Form".

- implement the "Browse" page as two panels. There will be a tree
on the left side to show a hierarchy of things like instruments, experiments,
shifts, runs:

  AMOS
    Chapman1
      shifts
        begin: 2009-07-17 10:22:01
          run: 123
          run: 124
        begin: 2009-07-17 11:29:14
        ..
      runs
        run: 123
        run: 124
        ...
      all messages

On the right siode there will be another panel showing messages in a selected
context. The messages will be sorted in the "Post" order. The messages will be
separated by th ebackground color like in YUI tables. Here is one way how
each message will be shown:

  +--------+--------+---------+---------------+-------------+
  | Posted |  Shift | Message | Tags          | Attachments |
  | Author |   Run  |         |               |             |
  +--------+--------+---------+---------------+-------------+

  | <time> | <time> | ...     | <tag>=<value> | <url>       |
  | <name> | <num>  | ...     | ...           | ...         |

  | <time> | <time> | ...     | <tag>=<value> | <url>       |
  | <name> | <num>  | ...     | ...           | ...         |

  | <time> | <time> | ...     | <tag>=<value> | <url>       |
  | <name> | <num>  | ...     | ...           | ...         |

  ...

Repeat the table header every 10 messages.

Another (perhaps - better) possibility would be to use YUI tables.


- suggestions on the LogBook implementation made by others (LCLS Data Management
Meeting July 9, 2009):

1. ask for the user confirmation before closing the shift
2. allow single-line input for messages must be possible with RETURN

- perhaps implement a better (from the visualisation standpoint) table
navigation buttons

- finish implementing the "Run Summary" page using Run Summary Parameters from
BABAR LogBook as an example.

- think about implementing Next-Previous navigation for shifts and runs

- think about the general navigation between Experiment Summary, "Shift Summary" and
"Run Summary"
