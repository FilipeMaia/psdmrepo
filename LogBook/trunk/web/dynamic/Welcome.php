    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="width:800px;">The Electronic LogBook is designed to anotate data 
    taken during the LCLS experiments. The data are stored in a database. This
    application allows for an interactive browsing and inserting new data into
    the database. The contents of the database can also be updated/modified
    directly by other applications from the LCLS Detector Control and LCLS OFFLINE
    domains.
    Pease refer to the documentation on the application found in the <b>Help</b>
    section of the top-level menu. You can also submit bug reports, suggestions
    using the built-in <b>Help</b>.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>NOTE</b></p>
    <p style="width:640px;">In order to better assist with usability problems the application may
    record your activities and get them stored in the database. The gathered
    information will be used to analyze a sequence of actions and your (and
    others') input made before a problem occured.</p>
