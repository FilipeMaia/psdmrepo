          The Electronic LogBook is designed as a mean of annotating the preparatory
          and data taking phases of the LCLS experiments. The LogBook stores its data
          in a database. This application allows for an interactive browsing and inserting
          new data into the database. The contents of the database can also be updated
          by other applications from the LCLS Detector Control and LCLS OFFLINE
          domains.
          Please refer to the documentation on the application found in the <b>Help</b>
          section of the top-level menu. You can also submit bug reports, suggestions
          using the built-in <b>Help</b>.</p>

          <p><b>Supported browsers: </b>Note that this is a so called "rich" Web application
          which heavily uses JavaScript. Older and less advanced Web browsers may not support
          certain features on which the application's implementation relies upon.
          If you notice any problems with page rendering or the dynamic behavior
          please consider upgrading your browser.
          The application has been successfully tested against the following browsers: Firefox 3.x,
          Chrome, Safari 4 and Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 (in both native
          and compatibility modes).</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Browsers' navigation buttons: </b>Please, avoid using them for now! The future

          <p><b>Problems monitoring: </b>In order to better assist users with any problems
          (should they occur when using the application) the application may record selected
          user activities and get them stored in the database. The gathered information can
          be used to analyze a sequence of actions and user's input made before
          a problem occurs.</p>
