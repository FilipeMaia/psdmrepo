EARLY FEEDBACK FROM AMEDEO (Aug 19, 2009)

+ run Welcome.html through the spell check (typos make people crazy!)
+ have at least one entry ready in the attachments dialog when posting new messages or replies.
  Then allow people to add more (replace "Expand" with something else like "Add"). Do the same for tags.
+ shorten the path to: https://pswww/apps/logbook. Do thit before making the server
  open to the internet and advertizing its expernal URL.
+ serve LogBook as all lower-case logbook. Follow the same approach for other apps and services
- Talk to Teresa on when we can get the server open.
- provide a read-only version of the LogBook which wouldn't require any authentication. Serve these
- set up WebAuth on the pswww
- set up cron-tab on 'psdb' to make daily 'mysqldump' of all databases onto an NFS disk
- revisit the server and applications security (SQL injection, error reports, etc.)
- check with Len Moss on a possibility to urn 'amoopr' into an account with a password

BUGS
Grabber
- put a title to the grabber (root.title())
- order group names alphabetically when selecting POSIX Group in the Experiment Registration Dialog
- add user group search (LDAP) in the experiment registry based on user name or his account name. This is to simplify a selection of
the group.
- improve the PHP LDAP API at RegDB to recognize secondary groups as well.
- fix the "crosstalk" of the 'Options' buttons in the 'New Message' anbd 'Reply' dialogs.

NEW IDEAS

    1. begin working on implementing subthreads in the message list:

    2. implement a persistent address for the individual messages (successAction or
    actionSuccess). That would allow expanding message trees

    3. implement a viewer for an individual message tree in a separate page (like
    Experiment status, etc.).

_________________________________________________
HIGH PRIORITY: Consider extending database schema

    1. storing both user account name and his name entered into the box when
    posting messages. If no user name is provided when entering a new message then
    use LDAP entry for the account to get its name.

    2. move tags from message header to message entries


___________________________________________
MEDIUM PRIORITY: Improve 'New Shift' dialog

    1. in order to simplify crew formation allow using checkboxes to select
    members of the POSIX group registered with an experiment. Also allow adding
    arbitrary people (as it's done now).

      [ text ] or [ listbox ]

    The contents of the listbox will be populated by members of a POSIX group
    associated with the selected experiment. Th erequest will be sent dynamically
    using AJAX.

____________________________________________________________________________
LOW PRIORITY: Refactor the Messages Table and Dialog into a single prototype

    var ms = new  MessagesDisplay (
      element,            // HTML 'div' element where to place the display's markup
      url,                // optional URL to request messages. If not used then should be set to 'null'
      scope,              // 'experiment', 'shift', 'run' - one of these current selections
      new_message_dialog, // {true,false} - the flag requesting the dialog to be available
      auto_refresh,       // {true,false} - the flag requesting the feature to be available
      scope_selectors     // {true,false} - the flag requesting the feature to be available
    );

    NOTES: The class will be using the following global variables and markup:
    current_selection
    "workarea"

__________________________________________________
LOW PRIORITY: Imnprovements for the screen-grabber

    - allow composing a message with more than one attachment
    - add options for posting messages for the current experiment, shift or run.
    Right now it's for the selected experiment only. Use experiment status.
    - allow specifying arbitrary tags (or the preconfigured tags for the experiment)

______________________________________________________________________________
LOW PRIORITY: interesting vizualization idea: when showing a list of messages
indicate 'zones' of shifts annd runs. Zones can be shown with different colors
and indentation. Additional zone identifiers (begin time and leader of a shift
and run number) can be used as well. For example:

    <no shift - no background color>
    | + Shift: 2009-09-17 10:12:23 - leader: gapon
    |          2009-09-17 10:22:34 - by: salnikov - the test message
    |          ..
    ||  + Run: 2009-09-17 11:12:23 - number: 12
    ||         ..
    |
    ||  + Run: 2009-09-17 12:12:23 - number: 13
    ||         ..
    |
    <no shift - no background color>
    | + Shift: 2009-09-17 10:12:23 - leader: gapon

    Another possibility would be to use '+ today', '+ yesterday', '+last week', 'last month'
    to group messages similar to what's done in Outlook Express
____________________________________________________
LOW PRIORITY: more ideas on the Look And Feel design

    - Finish implementing selectors/checkboxs (experiment, shifts, runs) in 'Operator
    and Control System Messages' dialog.

    - Create curved background images for subtitles such as: 'Summary', 'Operator and
    Control System Messages', etc. Find agoo dcolor match. Defer this setting to CSS.
    Another (perhaps a beteer option) would be to use images for borders and the same
    background color for 'div'.

    - Consider 'discussion tree' option in both modes.

    - implement 'thumbs' mode for images in the 'Browse' and 'Search' modes. Each image will
    also carry a URL to the full document. HAve a button to togle the thumbs on and off.
    Where to put the one?
    One nice possibility would be to put attachments after tags. That would allow
    seeing previews as a photo-album grid. Put an empty image 'No Preview available'
    for unsupported MIME types.

      ------------------
      |                | <name>
      |                | type: jpg
      |    Thumb       | Size: 123545
      |                | [ Download ]
      |                | [ View ]

    - add 'fit page' pagination mode for 'detailed'

    - implement a support for Browser's history buttons (PREV/NEXT)

________________________________________________________________________________
LOW PRIORITY: implement "double" buffering-like behavior when navigating
between (Prev/Next) runs and shifts. The feature must be especially usefull for
runs because it would allow comparing values of run parameters.
__________________________________________________________________________
LOW PRIORITY: put something into the Help menus. Consider placing question
mark icons (suported by hyperlinks) throughout document pages.

________________________________________________________________________________
INTERESTING IDEA: In the 'Operator and Control System Messages' introduce an
option for viewing messages timestamps in the "back in time" mode. For example,
to show how many seconds/minutes/hours/days ago was the last posting. That would
give an operator some sense of timing in the automatically updated mode as well.

LOW PRIORITY: Look at the browser history support.

LOW PRIORITY: Implement PDF export using either FPDF or PDFlib.
