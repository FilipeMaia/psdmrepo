- suggestions made by Amadeo:

1. be more explicit in the name of commands and contexts (
  Experiment Summary,
  Search Messages
  Browse Current Experiment
  ...
2. implement top-level submenu to select experiments through instruments
3. implement the same options for viewing messages as in Search message view
6. implement images/windows/screen grabber to output the grabbed contents
straight into the database.

- add 'Begin New Shift' operation on the 'Experiment Summary' page

- finish implementing 'Search'

1. Consider 'discussion tree' option in both modes.
2. Implement a paginator in the 'detailed' presentation modes.
3. implement 'thumbs' mode for images in the 'Browse' and 'Search' modes. Each image will
also carry a URL to the full document. HAve a button to togle the thumbs on and off.
Where to put the one?
One nice possibility would be to put attachments after tags. That would allow
seeing previews as a photo-album grid. Put an empty image 'No Preview available'
for unsupported MIME types.

  ------------------
  |                | <name>
  |                | type: jpg
  |    Thumb       | Size: 123545
  |                | [ Download ]
  |                | [ View ]

4. add 'fit page' pagination mode for both 'compact' and 'detailed'

- consider redesigning the schema to associate tags with entries, not headers?

- perhaps implement a better (from the visualisation standpoint) table
navigation buttons

- implement a support for Browser's history buttons (PREV/NEXT)

- consider extending the schema to allow storying user name along with user's
account name. This will be needed for the "shared accounts" security model of
LCLS experiments.

- (IMPORTANT FEATURE?) implement "double" buffering-like behavior when navigating
between (Prev/Next) runs and shifts. The feature must be especially usefull for
runs because it would allow comparing values of run parameters.

- (HIGH PRIORITY) implement opening a new shift. Add the corresponding option into
the top-level menu bar. Also add a button on the experiment's Summary page.

- (LOW PRIORITY?) put something into the Help menus. Expand the menu

- (INTERESTING IDEA) Consider adding the 'Live Mode' to the Operator Messages
Display (that separate window show when clicking onto a message entry). In that
mode the display would automatically show all new messages. That would be really
cool feature which isn't in any E-Log!!!

- (INTERESTING IDEA) Also in that 'Live Mode' show how many seconds/minutes/hours/days
ago was the last posting. That would also give an operator some sense of timing.
BTW, the very same feature can be easily implemented in all message tables. Of course
this only make sense if tables are updated by a timer.

- LOOK AT THE BROWSER HISTORY SUPPORT

- (POSSIBLY) EXTEND THE SCHEMA TO KEEP THE ACCOUNT NAME AND USER NAME. IF NO USER
NAME IS PROVIDED THEN GET IT FROM THE REGISTRY DATABASE (LDAP) AND STORE THE ONE
ALONG WITH THE MESSAGE.

- Implement PDF export using either FPDF or PDFlib.
