          The Electronic LogBook is designed to anotate data
          taken during the LCLS experiments. The data are stored in a database. This
          application allows for an interactive browsing and inserting new data into
          the database. The contents of the database can also be updated/modified
          directly by other applications from the LCLS Detector Control and LCLS OFFLINE
          domains.

          section of the top-level menu. You can also submit bug reports, suggestions
          using the built-in <b>Help</b>.</p>
