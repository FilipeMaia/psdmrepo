LOW PRIORITY: Refactor the Messages Table and Dialog into a single prototype

    var ms = new  MessagesDisplay (
      element,            // HTML 'div' element where to place the display's markup
      url,                // optional URL to request messages. If not used then should be set to 'null'
      scope,              // 'experiment', 'shift', 'run' - one of these current selections
      new_message_dialog, // {true,false} - the flag requesting the dialog to be available
      auto_refresh,       // {true,false} - the flag requesting the feature to be available
      scope_selectors     // {true,false} - the flag requesting the feature to be available
    );

    NOTES: The class will be using the following global variables and markup:
    current_selection
    "workarea"

VERY IMPORTANT: Screen-grabber button!!! This is very essential feature
to begin using the LogBook.

LOW PRIORITY: interesting vizualization idea: when showing a list of messages
indicate 'zones' of shifts annd runs. Zones can be shown with different colors
and indentation. Additional zone identifiers (begin time and leader of a shift
and run number) can be used as well. For example:

    <no shift - no background color>
    | + Shift: 2009-09-17 10:12:23 - leader: gapon
    |          2009-09-17 10:22:34 - by: salnikov - the test message
    |          ..
    ||  + Run: 2009-09-17 11:12:23 - number: 12
    ||         ..
    |
    ||  + Run: 2009-09-17 12:12:23 - number: 13
    ||         ..
    |
    <no shift - no background color>
    | + Shift: 2009-09-17 10:12:23 - leader: gapon

    Another possibility would be to use '+ today', '+ yesterday', '+last week', 'last month'
    to group messages similar to what's done in Outlook Express

HIGH PRIORITY: implement suggestions made by Amadeo

    3. implement the same options for viewing messages as in Search message view
    4. implement images/windows/screen grabber to output the grabbed contents
    straight into the database. Consider the one from BABAR.

    5. Be more verbose in subtitles ("Experiment Summary" instead of "Summary",
    "Runs of the shift" instead of "Runs", etc.)

    9. When starting a new shift allow selecting a leader from the POSIX group. Also allow
    adding crew members from the same group.

    11. Fix instrument names to follow the tree-letter achronym ('AMOS' to 'AMO', etc.).
    Also fix 'SXS' to 'SXR'?

____________________________________________________
LOW PRIORITY: more ideas on the Look And Feel design

    - Finish implementing selectors/checkboxs (experiment, shifts, runs) in 'Operator
    and Control System Messages' dialog.

    - Create curved background images for subtitles such as: 'Summary', 'Operator and
    Control System Messages', etc. Find agoo dcolor match. Defer this setting to CSS.
    Another (perhaps a beteer option) would be to use images for borders and the same
    background color for 'div'.

    - Consider 'discussion tree' option in both modes.

    - implement 'thumbs' mode for images in the 'Browse' and 'Search' modes. Each image will
    also carry a URL to the full document. HAve a button to togle the thumbs on and off.
    Where to put the one?
    One nice possibility would be to put attachments after tags. That would allow
    seeing previews as a photo-album grid. Put an empty image 'No Preview available'
    for unsupported MIME types.

      ------------------
      |                | <name>
      |                | type: jpg
      |    Thumb       | Size: 123545
      |                | [ Download ]
      |                | [ View ]

    - add 'fit page' pagination mode for 'detailed'

    - implement a support for Browser's history buttons (PREV/NEXT)

________________________________________________________________________________
LOW PRIORITY: implement "double" buffering-like behavior when navigating
between (Prev/Next) runs and shifts. The feature must be especially usefull for
runs because it would allow comparing values of run parameters.
__________________________________________________________________________
LOW PRIORITY: put something into the Help menus. Consider placing question
mark icons (suported by hyperlinks) throughout document pages.

________________________________________________________________________________
INTERESTING IDEA: In the 'Operator and Control System Messages' introduce an
option for viewing messages timestamps in the "back in time" mode. For example,
to show how many seconds/minutes/hours/days ago was the last posting. That would
give an operator some sense of timing in the automatically updated mode as well.

__________________________________________________
LOW PRIORITY: Look at the browser history support.

___________________________________________________
MEDIUM PRIORITY: Consider extending database schema

    1. storing both user account name and his name entered into the box when
    posting messages. If no user name is provided when entering a new message then
    use LDAP entry for the account to get its name.

    2. move tags from message header to message entries

LOW PRIORITY: Implement PDF export using either FPDF or PDFlib.
