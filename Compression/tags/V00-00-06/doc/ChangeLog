Package author: Igor Gaponenko

Please describe any modifications that you made to the package in the
reverse time order.

Tag: V00-00-06
2011-11-15 Igor Gaponenko
- fixed bugs in the MT wrapper
- added StreamCompresor wrapper (which still needs to be optimized for
the best performance)

Tag: V00-00-05
2011-11-10 Igor Gaponenko
- minor reimplementation of the multi-threaded wrapper in order to get rid of
the confusing parameter 'maxImagesPerThread'. In the new version of the wrapper
a value of this parameter is calculated automatically per each compression request
based on the number of images in the request and the maximum number of threads
specified in the wrapper's constructor.
- removed the above mentioned parameter from the c-tor of the wrapper
- made adjustments to the test applications using the wrapper

2011-11-10 Igor Gaponenko
- improved the histogram analysis algorithm to locate the base in arbitrary
(non CSPad only) distributions of values.
- added diagnostic printouts garded by C++ macro-processor directives. Uncomment
them if needed.
- added a test application for "internal" compression of XTC files at a level
of datagrams.

Tag: V00-00-03
2011-11-07 Igor Gaponenko
- fixed a bug (buffer overflow) in the CSPad compression algorithm which may result
in memory corruption if an image size would be on the border-line of compression.

Tag: V00-00-02
2011-09-12 Andy
- SConscript: defined empty UTESTS so that build does not try to run test
  apps as unit tests
- fixed compilation warnings in tests

Tag: V00-00-01
2011-08-19 Igor Gaponenko
- initial version of the package
- CSPad compression/decompression algorithms, multithreaded wrapper and three tests
