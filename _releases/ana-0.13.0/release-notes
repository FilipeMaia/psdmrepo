Added architecture support for RHEL7, GCC48:
- SConsTools

New external packages:
- fftw
- pyFFTW

Improved ONLINE monitoring:
- psmon

Improved XTC indexing:
- psana
- psana_python
- PSXtcInput

Merge DAQ controlled IOC streams with regular ones:
- XtcInput (change low level stream/datagram processing, use seconds/fiducials to order events)
- PSXtcInput
- PSXtcMPInput (merge DAQ controlled IOC streams, work with list of dgrams)
- PSXtcOutput (affected by the XtcInput migration, work with list of dgrams)
- Translator (affected by the XtcInput migration)
- O2OTranslator (affected by the XtcInput migration)
- psana_examples (demonstrate use of list of dgrams)
- psana_test (tests for meged streams, also test for psana parallel mode)

Notes on low-level interface changes in psana (by David):
- we no longer put a Dgram in the Event, we put a new object called a DgramList.
  It is very unlikely anyone was using Dgram, however I made an example of using
  DgramList for psana_examples. PSXtcOutput seemed to be the only thing getting
  a Dgram from the event store. now it gets a DgramList. One could imagine
  something like CASS using psana to get a list of dgrams rather than using
  psana's high level interface. That kind of application would now brake.

Notes for the Translator:
- updates for split scan mode
- address issue with merging DAQ controlled IOC streams 
- there is currently a known issue with the Translator, it will not translate
  the DAQ src alias list from both the DAQ and the IOC streams. It will
  probably translate the DAQ list, but which one is undefined.

Improvements in calibrations and imaging algorithms:
- CSPadPixCoords
- ImgAlgos
- PyCSPadImage
