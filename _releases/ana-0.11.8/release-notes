This is a bug fix relese for the HDF5 translator. Here is a summary of
changes in specific packages:

Translator:
- fix bug with translating timetool EPICS pv's.
- translate EPICS pv when they arrive in the xtc rather than when their time stamp
  changes. EPICs datasets will generally be longer.
- add option to translate EPICS on every shot - store most recent pv seen.

psddl_pds2psana:
- take optional event tag for storing epics pvs. Allows epicsStore to save later
  of pvs from multiple recorders, allows modules to identify the events when
  an epics pv has been stored

psana_test:
- regenerate previousDump.txt based on new epics storage model add unit test
  for storing most recent pv from multiple sources

psana:
- add newline after dumping contents of config file

PSXtcInput:
- pass counter when storing epics pv, for storing most recent pv from multiple
  recorders and identifying events when a pv has been stored


PSEnv:
- rework epics store eventTag interface and logic, add method to 
  EpicsStoreImpl so psana modules can get eventTag and see whan a pv has 
  been stored

ImgAlgos:
- minor improvements in the diagnostic messages printouts
