xtcav:
- new analysis package (code written by Alvaro Sanchez-Gonzalez with some help
  from Christopher O'Grady)

psana:
- PSShmemInput: Reduce queue depth in DgramSourceShmem from 32 to 3.
  This is because shmem applications want minimal latency, which requires minimal
  buffering (at the expense of potentially more dropped events).
- add support for Epix100a

psana_examples:
- DumpEpix.cpp - add support for new types Psana::Epix::Config100aV1 and Psana::Epix::ElementV2

ImgAlgos:
- EpixNDArrProducer: add support for Epix::ElementV2 and Epix::Config100aV1

CalibManager:
- ConfigParametersForApp, ConfigFileGenerator add support for Epix100a
- use calibtypes from config pars in stead of evaluation from source
- ConfigParametersForApp: support for Epix100a, add 'geometry', update default list of sources

PSCalib:
- SegGeometryCspad2x1V1.py: move common methods to SegGeometry.py, improve self-documentation
- add SegGeometryEpix100V1(.py, .cpp, .h)
- in SegGeometryStore(.py, .h): add SegGeometryEpix100V1
- test/ex_seg_geometry_store.cpp: updated for epix100
- in CalibParsStore.h, GenericCalibPars.cpp: add support for Epix100a

pdscalibdata:
- add Epix100aBaseV1.h

pypsalg:
- Throttle warning messages in find_blobs.py.
- Fix missing imports and add 2D histogram in Histogram.py.

psmon:
- Fix from Dan that prevents psplot from "falling behind" when ZMQ buffers
  on the client (display side) fill up.

PSXtcInput:
- Fix a bug in the indexing access to calibcycle times: multiple streams' calibcycles were
  being included in the list. To avoid duplicates, reduced it to just one stream's
  calibcycles (since they are all identical).
