psana:
- Allow user to override /reg/d/psdm as default location for data using
  environment variable SIT_PSDM_DATA
- psana_test: minor update
- psana_python: add boost converters for Event,Env,Source.
- eliminated strong ROOT dependency and teh relevant (obsolete)
  histogramming service API (PSAS-131)
- changed the API to the main histogramming service which is now returned
  as a shared pointer instead of a reference (PSAS-131)

Calibration algorithms and tools:
- pdscalibdata: AndorBaseV1.h - set Rows=0, Cols=0 in order to support variable
  shape for 514x512 and 2048x2048 data (PSAS-6, PSAS-121)
  in NDArrIOV1.cpp - in constructor 2 set m_size = nda_def.size(), other things
  are cosmetic.
- CalibManager: add option to select dark events in any run using event
  code filter (PSAS-122), add GUIAlignment, and widget wrapper GUIROIMask (PSAS-6,
  PSAS-11). In many modules use class Frame in stead of QFrame + many cosmetic changes.
- PSCalib: add support for calibration types pixel_mask, pixel_bkgd; fix problem
  with different ndarray size/shape for common_mode.
  GeometryObject - delete and make new array pointers only if array size is
  changing (PSAS-11)

Imaging algorithms and tools
- ImgAlgos: add module EventCodeFilter (PSAS-122).
  PixCoordsProducer - move calls of savePixCoordsInCalibStore(env)
  in checkCalibPars(...) (PSAS-11)
- PSQt: Add modules WdgColorBar, WdgRadHist, WdgSpecHist, add multiple
  protections - the 1st stable version with all basic features (PSAS-11).
  Improve doxygen documentation, cleenup code.
 
External packages:
- pypsalg: added many new python wrappers to C methods in psalg.
- PSQt: this is the new package with the C++ GUI-based application for detector
  alignment using Qt4
- pytopsana: this is the new package with python to psana interface classes/methods
