This is the first RHEL7-ready release. It's mostly based on
ana-0.15.9 except fixes needed to compile and build this release
for RHEL7. These exception are mentioned below.

The modified external packages:
- ndarray_ext (boost 1.55.0)
- psdata (boost 1.55.0, headers migration in RHEL7)
- psalg (boost 1.55.0)

One external package had to be removed:
- ds9

And here is a list of the "own" packages which had to be modified/adopted
for RHEL7:
- ImgAlgos: note, that due to some technical limitation of the build system
  which can't build off branches this tag is pulled from the future (yet to
  be build) release ana-0.15.10.
- PSCalib
- cheetah
- Translator
