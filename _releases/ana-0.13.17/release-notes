psana:
- EvrData DataV4: this new type provides the convenience function
  present(evrcode) which returns 1 if an evr code is present. Users
  need not search through the FIFOEvents list. A 'present' table
  will be translated to hdf5 as well. Matlab Hdf5 users need to be
  careful about 1-up vs 0-up indexing and lookup evrcode+1 in
  the present table. EvrData DataV4 may replace DataV3 in new data
  as soon as Feb 25/2015. 
- TimeTool: added options "beam_on_off_key" and "laser_on_off_key"
  to allow a Psana module to override TimeTool logic that categorizes events.
  See documentation at psana Module Catalog - TimeTool.Analyze. (PSAS-102)
- xtcav: Improve island separation and delay calculation for 2-bunch
  mode. Fix bug where inter bunch delay function would fail for vectors
  with an odd number of elements.
- live mode: add parameter to have psana wait for new runs in live
  mode (PSAS-108)

pypsalg:
- add "values" method to histogram axis class (useful for plotting).

Translator: 
- fastindex feature added to MPI Split-scan Translator for purposes of
  online analysis (PSAS-98)
- look for and translate data that user Psana Modules produce during
  BeginJob/BeginRun/BeginCalibCycle as well as EndJob/EndRun/EndCalibCycle.
  If found during the End* methods, create subgroup EndData to standard
  groups for this data. (PSAS-101)
- add "split_cc_in_subdir" option to write cc files in a separate
  subdirectory. (PSAS-104, PSWA-32)
- Bump overall hdf5 schema version from 4 to 5.
- Previously, setting the option type_filter=exclude psana did not
  exclude epics. Now it will exclude epics. 

DDL:
- Rewrite DDL compiler wrappers to: (follow up to PSAS-103)
- exclude smalldata from Translator and hdf2psana backends
- optionally support DEVEL switch

PSCalib:  
- GeometryObject: add method get_geo_pars (PSAS-11).
- GeometryAccess, GeometryObject, SegGeometryMatrixV1: improve memory
  management (PSAS-34).
- GeometryObject: add parameter do_eval in get_pixel_coords(...) and
  evaluate_pixel_coords(...).
- CalibFileFinder.py: in method findCalibFileadd add protection for
  run numbers > 9999 (PSAS-111).

PSQt: 
- Add many classes for GUI and logger (PSAS-34).
- Implement signal and slot methods for communication between project
  objects, connect all parts of app in GUIMain.
- Improve memory management in GeometryAccess, GeometryObject,
  SegGeometryMatrixV1 by deleting old objects before updates.

Bugs fixed:
- PSXtcInput: Do not look for configure transition in second chunk of an ioc
  recorder stream when in Index mode

Deprecated Features:
- o2o-translate has been removed from the release. Users needing
  to re-translate old data should use an old release. o2o-translate
  has hot been able to translate new DAQ types for a while.
- psana-translate non MPI split scan has been removed. It is no longer
  useful now that the MPI spilt scan translator has matured.
- psana-translate filtered groups have been removed. These groups kept
  track of events filtered from translation using the "do_not_translate"
  keyword that the Translator picks up. The feature was not required.

External Packages:
- update to pdsdata 8.2.4 for EvrData DataV4
- updated ROOT to version 5.34.25 (PSAS-96)
