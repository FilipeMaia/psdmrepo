- The Translator is now able to translate variable length ndarrays.

- Fixed psana XTC input module to only add one damagemap for the case where
indexing tries to fix split events. Previously the code  would throw
an "identical key" exception.

- Fixed a memory management problem in the psana calibration modules
- Fixed problems with Doxygen documentation generation in a number of packages

- Improve bookkeeping quality in log files of the Calibration Manager
- Add group operations in the file manager of the Calibration Manager

- Print warning to help C++ users get ndarrays of const elements from
the Event when they forgot to add the const qualifier.

- Fix bug with printing event keys that include ndarray's of const items.
The bug affected the Python API to the psana event.

- Check for ambiguous conversion of a const/non-const pair of ndarrays
to one numpy array.

- Make the Python interface to DAQ datatypes consistent with the C++
interface - methods of DAQ datatypes that return numpy arrays now return
read-only arrays. Users that were modifying the data in place now need
to make a deep copy, ie: my_array = my_array.copy().
