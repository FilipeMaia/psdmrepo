psana:
- allow default calibDir to be set using environment variable SIT_PSDM_DATA
- psana_test: add diagnostic/testing script and C++ Psana module

Imaging algorithms and tools:
- ImgAlgos: NDArrCalib - add method printMaskAndBkgd()
- pyimgalgos: GlobalGraphics.py - add singleton Store, and methods
  plot_img and fig_axes.

Bug fixes:
- psana: fix bug with small data xtc. It was running out of file
  handles when processing small data file. (PSAS-130)
- PSCalib,CorAna,CalibManager: migration to the new version of NumPy
- TimeTool.Analyze: do not create a .root file if dump=0 specified,
  the bug was that it created an empty .root file, causing MPI jobs
  to crash (PSAS-135)
- TimeTool.(Analyze,Setup): updated to look for both EvrDataV4 as well
  as EvrDataV3. Used to get warnings about no evr data for new data
  with EvrDataV4.
