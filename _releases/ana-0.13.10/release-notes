- xtcav: Included python-docstrings for the relevant
  classes/methods/functions; some cleanup from the repo of some old
  files that were not longer in use; added a few more retrieval
  functions to the ShotToShotCharacterization class, all of them
  follow the format where the last argument is a flag telling whether
  it was possible to retrieve the data; solved minor bugs (courtesy of
  Alvaro Sanchez-Gonzales).

- CSPadPixCoords: in CSPadImageProducer.cpp, GlobalMethods.cpp,
  CSPad2x2NDArrReshape.cpp, CSPad2x2ImageProducer.cpp - put warning
  messages about missing data under control of print_bits (PSAS-83)

- ImgAlgos: in many moduls put warning messages about missing data
  under control of print_bits (PSAS-83)

- pypsalg: Include new find_blobs.py (courtesy of TJ Lane) which has
  an extra optional keyword argument to discard small blobs.  Fix bugs
  in 2D histogram in Histogram.py.

- CalibManager: add Frame.py, re-factoring GUIHelp.py (PSAS-6)

- TimeTool: updated to understand ConfigV2 data from more recent
  experiments. Likewise publishes a DataV2 in the event store as
  opposed to a DataV1. Users modifying code from older experiments
  will have to update similar to how they do for new data types in xtc
  files. Additionally, added more histograms for dump to root file,
  two ROI analysis, and removed need to specify empty ROIs,
  ipm_get_key.
