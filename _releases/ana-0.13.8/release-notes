Release identity mechanism (NEW):
- This is the first release supporting release self-identity mechanism.
The release information is provided via a special package ReleaseInfo
which is injected at a release build stage. Details can be found in
the description of the JIRA ticket PSRT-36.

ImgAlgos: 
- NDArrCalib.cpp: move conditional printCalibPars() after constants loading (PSAS-44)
- AlgSmearing, AlgDroplet: for droplet/peak finding (PSAS-68)
- CommonMode: to collect all common mode correction algorithms
- NDArrCalib, CommonMode: add common mode support for Epix100a (PSAS-7)

PSCalib:
- CalibParsStore.h, GenericCalibPars.cpp: improve conditional output (PSAS-44)
- GenericCalibPars.cpp: workaround for compilation problems with dbg (PSAS-67)

pdscalibdata:
- in all *BaseV*.h classes: workaround for compilation problems with dbg (PSAS-67)

CalibManager:
- add app/roicon for conversion of the ROI mask into ndarray using geometry calib file (PSAS-10)

psana_python, pypsalg:
- new BOOST converters and functions to allow psalg to be called from python, courtesy of Ankush Mitra.

DDL packages:
- support for new DAQ types in pdsdata 8.1.10 - TimeTool::ConfigV2, TimeTool::DataV2, and Quartz::ConfigV2.
- Improved documentation for two DDL types: FEEGasDetEnergyV1 and BldDataGMDV2

pdsdata (external package):
- update to 8.1.10 for new DAQ types discussed above

pdscalibdata (fixed bugs):
- NDArrIOV1: get_ndarray() now returns reference in stead of ndarray
- improve conditional output for debugging (PSAS-44).

PSXtcInput (fixed bugs):
- allow individual input modules to customize what features of PSXtcInputModuleBase
they support (necessary for indexing input module to not hang in certain instances). (PSAS-66).

PSCalib (fixed bugs):
- GeometryAccess.py in img_from_pixel_arrays(iX, iY, W=None, ...) add protection for W=None (PSAS-11)

XtcInput (fixed bugs):
- check for certain kinds of damage in Xtc to allow psana to get through data produced
in some runs of xppc014, xppf0814, meca2614. Xtc problem has since been fixed. (PSAS-71).
