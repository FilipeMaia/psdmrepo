Brief description:
==================

Goal is to develop a Python based framework to use MPI in a hub/viewer/workers architechture 
to process large detector data for a correlation calculation that users implement. The 
calculation does correlations across time for each pixel of a detector. Calculations on one
pixel are indepenet of calculations on another. This overlaps somewhat with the CorAna package.
