Please describe any modifications that you made to the package in the
reverse time order.

NextTag:
- pipe in finecolor file, produce it in maskColorTool
	
Tag: V00-00-12:
- move import of matplotlib.plt to remove warning message about fork() Jira PSAS-163
	
Tag: V00-00-11:
- optimizations to get to real time with full cspad Jira PSAS-162:
-- change from float64 to float32 to speed up scatter and gather
-- specify 'float' type for psana NDArray modules
-- move server copy of masked pixels so it doesn't block workers
- This introduces change in UserG2 code for users	
- fix bug with formatFileName and %C
- start to undo circular inclusions of ParCorAna in src files
	
Tag: V00-00-09:
- fix bug with overriding system_parms via command line arguments
- improve error/diagnostic messages
	
Tag: V00-00-08:
- add MPI_Barrier with output to driver to check for MPI problems 
- make %C increase in h5 output file if there is a .inprogress file
- fix bug with overriding numServers through command line
- improve documentation
	
Tag: V00-00-07
- fix bugs with handling stream in dataset, need to specify streams for 
  non-standard streams, can't specify more servers than DAQ streams
- fix bug in UserG2, did not implement beforeData for incremental
- adjust documentation a bit
- take out userg2 page from sphinxdoc
- add modules to src	
- add code to parCorAnaMaskColorTool to check for geometry information that is
  wrong - on the tutorial data it returned iX, iY that were one pixel greater
  then the image size - image producer must have changed - now the geometry 
  file is out of sync?
	
Tag: V00-00-06
- remove XCorrWorkerBase and replace with WorkerData
- add unit tests for 60 events of cspad2x2
- add UserG2 for 3 methods - incremental accumulate, windowed, g2atend
- update documenation and default_params.py
- add support for %T and %C in h5output file, with unit test
- extend parCorAnaMaskColorTool to create testmask with 10 pixels on.
	
Tag: V00-00-05
- implement WorkerData for incrememtal calculation
- add some unit tests
- add psmon plotting
- before refactor to plug in WorkerData
	
Tag: V00-00-04
2015-4-10 David Schneider
- update sphinx documentation
- implement testing part of framework, and cmp script for h5 output
- change names of parameters in system_params/user_params, consistently camelcase
- change message structure to include more than just 120hz counter, pass full
  timing information to workers, viewer, etc
	
Tag: V00-00-03
2015-3-26 David A. Schneider
- switch to using fiducials for event time JIRA Issue PS-126. Servers include
  fiducial in their message to master, master computers counter from server info,
  workers & viewer only get counter.
- add optimization for debug messages, don't form debug strings unless we are 
  doing debug logging
- change name framework uses for xcorrbase to that, from g2, g2 is in user code
	
2015-3-24 David A. Schneider
- add sphinxdoc directory and .rst files for documentation.
  updated default_config.py to include the worker_store_dtype value
	
2015-1-21 David A. Schneider
- improve helper function returning delay list to always return requested # of delays
	
2015-1-20 David A. Schneider
- change default server assignment to round robin on available hosts
- take out automatic detection of server hosts for shmem
- identify instrument in psana datasource for shmem as well as exp=
	
2015-1-15 David A. Schneider
- get mask color tool to work with a detector that produces a 2D ndarray for which there is no geometry file

2015-1-15 David A. Schneider
- Fix bugs when using more than one server in live/offline mode when streams are not specified.

2015-1-15 David A. Schneider
- Initial check in. Based on package MpiDetectFn from users svn repo.
- JIRA Issue PSAS-63
