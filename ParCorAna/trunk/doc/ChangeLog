Package author: David A. Schneider

Please describe any modifications that you made to the package in the
reverse time order.

	
Tag: V00-00-25
- update default_config.py to include new UserG2 params for ipimbs
- work on documentation
- clean up some things in example config files
	
Tag: V00-00-24
- remove saturated pixels from finecolor as well as color data.
- add unit test for saturated pixels based on parsing output.
	
Tag: V00-00-23
- improve error message about saturated pixels being removed from colors
	
Tag: V00-00-22
- replace inefficient averaging over color and finecolors with efficient
  numpy.bincount. Should greatly increase spead of viewer with many colors.
- do not require h5output or testH5output to be set for test_main or test_alt modes
  useful for debugging config file with no h5output.
- warn/error about finecolor file == 0 when color file != 0
- UserG2 refactors: debugPlot function, loadColorFile function, replaceSubsetsWithAverage
  make modifications to colors based on saturated pixels more explicit
	
Tag: V00-00-21:
- save unit test results into files in /reg/g/psdm/data_test ... so that
  unit tests can compare to previously computed output. 
- Extend unit tests to compare to previous output.
- Modify compare tool to ignore testH5out system_param in comparing output files.
	
	
Tag: V00-00-20:
- add debugging statements
- add many user_parms, in particular parameters to filter based on ipimbs
- add 'debug_plot' and support to see some of the IP/G2/IF at viewerUpdate
- add forwarding functions logInfo, logDebug, etc to UserG2
- only plot the delays for which there is a nonzero count, cleans up plots
- label x-axis for plots in time, not 120hz counter
- add example config file for ffb live & plotting
	
Tag: V00-00-19:
- fix bug in viewerFormNDArrays. After gathering data from all the workers, the
  starting offset of each worker was not calculated properly - all but the first had 
  the same offset. The unit tests were passing because I never tested against multiple
  workers. The unit tests now using both multiple servers and multiple workers.

Tag: V00-00-18:
- fix bug with using a different base for forming delays with the delay function
	
Tag: V00-00-17:
- load mask and color files as int8 and int32 respectively in case they are float
- add error checking on mask/color/finecolor, call checkParams function from defaul_config.py
- add user_params 'plot_colors' to control number of colors plotted
- add 'print_delay_curves' to get start/stop of all delay curvers on the screen

	
Tag: V00-00-16:
- previous fix for mult servers slowed things down, server reads were not running in parrallel
- fixed this, see comments in JIRA PSAS-161 - servers now read next array after reporting ready,
  assumption is master will probably pick a different server to scatter
- added print of EventData, added class ScatterDataQueue
  
	
Tag: V00-00-15:
- fix issues with multiple servers: JIRA PSAS-161
  wait for all servers to by ready
  fix bug with selection earliest time
- use 6 servers for unit tests, compare to alt test with 1 server
- change cmp tool to ignore differences in numservers between alttest and maintest
- fix bug with saving finecolor file using parCorAnaMaskColorTool - it was just the color file before
	
Tag: V00-00-14:
- fix bug with writing mask/color files to h5 file.
- add documention on finecolor
	
Tag: V00-00-13:
- add finecolor
 
	
Tag: V00-00-12:
- move import of matplotlib.plt to remove warning message about fork() Jira PSAS-163
	
Tag: V00-00-11:
- optimizations to get to real time with full cspad Jira PSAS-162:
-- change from float64 to float32 to speed up scatter and gather
-- specify 'float' type for psana NDArray modules
-- move server copy of masked pixels so it doesn't block workers
- This introduces change in UserG2 code for users	
- fix bug with formatFileName and %C
- start to undo circular inclusions of ParCorAna in src files
	
Tag: V00-00-09:
- fix bug with overriding system_parms via command line arguments
- improve error/diagnostic messages
	
Tag: V00-00-08:
- add MPI_Barrier with output to driver to check for MPI problems 
- make %C increase in h5 output file if there is a .inprogress file
- fix bug with overriding numServers through command line
- improve documentation
	
Tag: V00-00-07
- fix bugs with handling stream in dataset, need to specify streams for 
  non-standard streams, can't specify more servers than DAQ streams
- fix bug in UserG2, did not implement beforeData for incremental
- adjust documentation a bit
- take out userg2 page from sphinxdoc
- add modules to src	
- add code to parCorAnaMaskColorTool to check for geometry information that is
  wrong - on the tutorial data it returned iX, iY that were one pixel greater
  then the image size - image producer must have changed - now the geometry 
  file is out of sync?
	
Tag: V00-00-06
- remove XCorrWorkerBase and replace with WorkerData
- add unit tests for 60 events of cspad2x2
- add UserG2 for 3 methods - incremental accumulate, windowed, g2atend
- update documenation and default_params.py
- add support for %T and %C in h5output file, with unit test
- extend parCorAnaMaskColorTool to create testmask with 10 pixels on.
	
Tag: V00-00-05
- implement WorkerData for incrememtal calculation
- add some unit tests
- add psmon plotting
- before refactor to plug in WorkerData
	
Tag: V00-00-04
2015-4-10 David Schneider
- update sphinx documentation
- implement testing part of framework, and cmp script for h5 output
- change names of parameters in system_params/user_params, consistently camelcase
- change message structure to include more than just 120hz counter, pass full
  timing information to workers, viewer, etc
	
Tag: V00-00-03
2015-3-26 David A. Schneider
- switch to using fiducials for event time JIRA Issue PS-126. Servers include
  fiducial in their message to master, master computers counter from server info,
  workers & viewer only get counter.
- add optimization for debug messages, don't form debug strings unless we are 
  doing debug logging
- change name framework uses for xcorrbase to that, from g2, g2 is in user code
	
2015-3-24 David A. Schneider
- add sphinxdoc directory and .rst files for documentation.
  updated default_config.py to include the worker_store_dtype value
	
2015-1-21 David A. Schneider
- improve helper function returning delay list to always return requested # of delays
	
2015-1-20 David A. Schneider
- change default server assignment to round robin on available hosts
- take out automatic detection of server hosts for shmem
- identify instrument in psana datasource for shmem as well as exp=
	
2015-1-15 David A. Schneider
- get mask color tool to work with a detector that produces a 2D ndarray for which there is no geometry file

2015-1-15 David A. Schneider
- Fix bugs when using more than one server in live/offline mode when streams are not specified.

2015-1-15 David A. Schneider
- Initial check in. Based on package MpiDetectFn from users svn repo.
- JIRA Issue PSAS-63
