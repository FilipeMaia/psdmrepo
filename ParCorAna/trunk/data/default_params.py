# Create psana options to calibrate detector data. Uses the ParCorAna.makePsanaOptions 
# utility function. One does:
#
#   * specify the type and src for the detector (above), 
#   * specify output keys for the two modules (below)
#   * save the resulting options and final ndarray type produced in the system_params dict. (see below). 
#
# The options can be extended after calling this function.
# To see the final options, just run this file as a standalone python script.
#
# Users can also skip calibration and just work with the NdArrayProducer output.

system_params['worker_store_dtype'] = np.float64  # The calibration system is creating ndarrays of
              # double - or np.float64. Each worker stores a portion of this ndarray. To guarantee no 
              # loss of precision, workers should store results in the same data format - i.e, float64.
              # However for large detectors and long correlation types, this may require too much 
              # memory. For full cspad where all pixels are included in the mask, and 50,000 times are stored
              # on the workers, this amounts to 50,000*(32*388*185)*8=855GB of memory that must be 
              # distributed amoung all the workers. If each host has 24GB (as it is presently), one would 
              # have to use 36 hosts. Given that each host runs 12 MPI ranks, we need 432 ranks for the workers.
              #
              # A simple way to use less memory, is to have the workers store the detector data as 4
              # byte floats, or change from np.float64 to np.float32. One could also try np.int16 to
              # get down to 2 bytes. It is not reccommended that one use unsigned integers as calibration
              # can produce negative values. Note that the delay curves will always be calculated with float64
              # in order to avoid loss of precision with that calculation. Changing the worker_store_type 
              # does not affect the precision of the delay curves.
              #
              # The system will emit warnings if the calibrated ndarrays have to be truncated to fit
              # into a worker_store_dtype that is not np.float64.


############## mask ##############
# The mask a numpy array of int's that must have the same shape as the detector array returned by
# the NDArr converter psana module. It must be 1 for elements to process, and 0 for elements not to process.
# Use the tool: mask_color_tool to create mask and color .npy files and convert between image and 
# ndarray coords
#
# note: a mask file must be provided.

system_params['mask_ndarrayCoords'] = "see __init__.py in ParCorAna/src for documentation on this parameter"

####### numservers serverhosts #################
# The servers are responsible for working through the data. If they do a lot of 
# processing of the detector data, such as complicated calibration, they can become a bottleneck.
# Running several servers in parallel can increase performance. The 'numservers' parameter allows
# users to increase the number of servers. When running from shared memory, only certain nodes have 
# access to the data. In this case, users need to specify the names of these hosts. This is what the
# 'serverhosts' parameter is for. 
#
# There are limits on the number of servers on can use. These depend on the input mode specified in the
# psana datasource string. When running in live mode, the most servers one can run is the number of 
# distinct DAQ streams (usually six). When running in indexing mode, there is no limit, but more 
# servers creates more I/O. Performance in index mode has not been evaluated. When running from shared 
# memory, there is no I/O limit on the number of servers. 
#
# The big limit on the number of servers is the balance of how many MPI ranks are servers vs. workers.
# Ideally, one uses as many workers as possible, while using enough servers to read through the data.
#
# For testing locally, it is reccommended that you use 1 server. 
#
# When running in live mode on the batch farm, it is recommended that you use the same number of 
# servers as you have DAQ streams. Most always this is 6. In addition, it is recommended that
# you run an MPI job with at least 12 * (numservers-1) + 1 procs - or at least 61. The framework will choose
# MPI ranks on distinct nodes when it can. It seems that having servers be on distinct nodes increases
# performance. Presently, each psana node has 12 cores, once you use 61 cores you're job will cover at 
# least 6 nodes.
#
# To see exactly how many DAQ streams you have, look at the files for your run. For example
#
#  ls -lrth /reg/d/psdm/xpp/xpptut13/xtc/*-r1437*.xtc

#  -r--r-x---+ 1 psdatmgr ps-data 9.4G Oct 20  2013 /reg/d/psdm/xpp/xpptut13/xtc/e308-r1437-s00-c00.xtc

# Shows that there are only 3 streams for run 1437 of the xpp tutorial data. Note, there is a difference
# between streams that are numbered at 80+ vs streams numbered less than 80. 80+ are control streams, and

# mode, do not use more streams than there are DAQ streams.
