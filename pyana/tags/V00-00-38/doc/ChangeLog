Please describe any modifications that you made to the package in the
reverse time order.

Tag: V00-00-38
2012-02-15 Andy Salnikov
- add support for event loop control from user modules

Tag: V00-00-37
2012-02-11 Andy Salnikov
- adding protection for zero-size EPICS channel data in the event
- print a warning in case zero-size EPICS channel data is detected,
  not much else can be done to correct the problem, and masking it 
  completely does not look like a right thing to do

Tag: V00-00-36
2012-02-10 Andy Salnikov
- gc.collect() on every event takes too much CPU, implementing better 
  algorithm. Now GC runs only if VM size grows larger than configured 
  number since (after) last GC run. Default for delta is 10MB. This
  should avoid running it frequently for small jobs

Tag: V00-00-35
2012-02-09 Andy Salnikov
- updating python docstrings everywhere

Tag: V00-00-34
2011-12-13 Andy Salnikov
- call gc.collect() in the event loops to clean up cycles from memory,
  without this virtual size tends to grow too much

Tag: V00-00-33
2011-11-11 Andy Salnikov
- few changes to Event class, mostly transparent to users
  - constructor now takes Evn object, used internally by new 
    wrapper methods
  - get() method now returns correctly wrapped data objects
    similar to all getXxxData()

Tag: V00-00-32
2011-10-11 Andy Salnikov
- bug fix in passing epics data to subprocesses

Tag: V00-00-31
2011-10-05 Andy Salnikov
- add fix to EPICS "multi-source" data

Tag: V00-00-30
2011-08-29 Andy Salnikov
- fix for EPICS bug in multi-process mode

Tag: V00-00-29
2011-06-27 Andy Salnikov
- added support for specifying BldInfo addresses in evt.get()

Tag: V00-00-28
2011-06-27 Andy Salnikov
- implemented ordering of cspad quadrants

Tag: V00-00-27
2011-05-21 - Andy Salnikov
- modules' methods endjob, endtrun, endcalibcycle now can
  be declared with three arguments (self, evt, env) instead of
  two arguments (self, env). 
- Number of arguments is discovered at run time, so this change 
  should be backward compatible
- With three arguments the methods receive standard event object 
  which can be used to exchange data between modules. 

Tag: V00-00-26
2011-03-31 - Andy Salnikov
- fix for zero-sized Epics XTC objects

Tag: V00-00-25
2011-03-28 - Andy Salnikov
- changed method dispatch so that beginjob/endjob is called only
  once per job, not per configure/unconfigure.
- if there are multiple configure transition in the same job the 
  warning will be printed.

Tag: V00-00-24
2011-02-24 - Andy Salnikov
- previous tag accidentally "overloaded" event.get() method, doing
  proper overload now

Tag: V00-00-23
2011-02-23 - Andy Salnikov
- added support for user data stored in event

Tag: V00-00-22
2011-02-22 - Andy Salnikov
- move pyana code to a separate module pyanamod 
- can be imported into other apps and called by passing parameters 
  through keyword arguments.

Tag: V00-00-21
2010-11-09 - Andy Salnikov
- event.py: change how DroppedContribution are handled at the container 
  level while scanning XTC containers 

Tag: V00-00-20
2010-10-14 - Andy Salnikov
- some changes in cspad module need update for event class 

Tag: V00-00-19
2010-09-21 - Andy Salnikov
- store config objects from Control level (ControlConfig) in environment
  in addition to standard Source level objects

Tag: V00-00-18
2010-09-03 - Andy Salnikov
- upgrade to pdsdata V02-07-00, Event class has new method getCsPadQuads()

Tag: V00-00-17
2010-08-23 - Andy Salnikov
- bug fix, user module endrun() was not called if -n N option was given
  to pyana (https://pswww.slac.stanford.edu/trac/psdm/ticket/30) 

Tag: V00-00-16
2010-07-07 - Andy Salnikov
- in pyana update environment even if we skip the events, EPICS data 
  come at random and need to  be remembered

Tag: V00-00-15
2010-07-07 - Andy Salnikov
- added skip option to pyanato not process fist N events
- user midules may have optional begincalibcycle and endcalibcycle
  methods which will be called for appropriate transitions
- beginrun and endrun methods were made optional too
- avoid creating ROOT files when not needed

Tag: V00-00-14
2010-06-23 - Andy Salnikov
- relax a bit filtering of damaged events

Tag: V00-00-13
2010-06-22 - Andy Salnikov
- event.py: filter out all bad XTC except those having ContainsIncomplete

Tag: V00-00-12
2010-06-22 - Andy Salnikov
- histo.py fix, ROOT now is not in module scope

Tag: V00-00-11
2010-06-22 - Andy Salnikov
- process damaged events too, do not look inside damaged XTCs ad detector 
  data level
- do not import ROOT unless really necessary, it interferes badly with 
  matplotlib
- add protection when loading config objects of unknown type

Tag: V00-00-10
2010-06-17 - Andy Salnikov
- HistoMgr is instantiated on demand only
- event object now has run() method, run number is guessed from
  the file name
- disappearing sub-process should be handled better now, the main
  process detects socket errors and stops

Tag: V00-00-09
2010-06-08 - Andy Salnikov
- changed Env.updateConfig to store all types of config objects 
  instead of selected subset

Tag: V00-00-08
2010-05-13 - Andy Salnikov
- updated event.Evt and event.Env for new types
- removed getConfig* methods from Event interface, use Env

Tag: V00-00-06
2010-04-14 - Andy Salnikov
- moved examples to a new package pyana_examples/
- bug fix in src/config, readfp(0 instead of read()

Tag: V00-00-05
2010-04-13 - Andy Salnikov
- subprocess ID is know available in environment, can be used to construct
  unique names
- updated example myana.py to use simple scipy algorithm 

Tag: V00-00-04
2010-04-12 - Andy Salnikov
- src/event.py: changed keyword params from detInfo to address
- src/config.py: all configuration stuff including command line options
  was moved here. Small refactoring oof pyana main().

Tag: V00-00-03
2010-04-09 - Andy Salnikov

- src/userana.py: allow multiple instances of the same analysis class
- examples/myana.py: updated to support many instances

Tag: V00-00-02
2010-04-02 - Andy Salnikov

- options can now be specified in config file, the same config file
  can contain options for user modules, see examples/myana.cfg

Tag: V00-00-01
