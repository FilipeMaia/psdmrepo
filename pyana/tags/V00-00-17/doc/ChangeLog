- added skip option to pyanato not process fist N events

- process damaged events too, do not look inside damaged XTCs ad detector 
  data level
- do not import ROOT unless really necessary, it interferes badly with 
  matplotlib
- add protection when loading config objects of unknown type

2010-06-17 - Andy Salnikov
- HistoMgr is instantiated on demand only
- event object now has run() method, run number is guessed from
  the file name

  process detects socket errors and stops
