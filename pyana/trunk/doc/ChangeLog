  data (configInt, configBool, etc.)
- add support for modules whose __init__ methods does not take any arguments

Tag: V00-00-60
2013-03-14 Andy Salnikov
- event.Env class has new method fwkName() which returns "pyana" string.
- identical method will exist in psana/Python Env class and it will
  return "psana"

Tag: V00-00-59
2013-02-27 Andy Salnikov
- my last fix did not work weel enough, here is a fix for that fix

Tag: V00-00-58
2013-02-27 Andy Salnikov
- use smarter event distribution in multi-process mode. When ready each 
  process posts its ID into a queue, dispatch reads ID of the next available 
  process from a que and sends L1Accept there.
- pyana adds --round-robin option to switch back to old implementation 
  of event distribution

Tag: V00-00-57
2013-02-06 Andy Salnikov

  fli.FrameV1, andor.FrameV1)

Tag: V00-00-49
2012-05-19 Andy Salnikov
- the code that detects zero-size EPICS payload crashed when very first
  epics in an event had zero size

Tag: V00-00-48
2012-04-24 Andy Salnikov
- implemented EPICS aliases support
- updated docstrings to include references to classes

Tag: V00-00-47
2012-04-10 Andy Salnikov
- added protection against corrupted type ID

Tag: V00-00-46
2012-04-02 Andy Salnikov
- Env.mkfile() creates temporary files in the same directory as 
  final output file

Tag: V00-00-45
2012-03-26 Andy Salnikov
- garbage collector had trouble collection after I added circular 
  references from Event to bound methods to Event
- breaking ref loop, it should work better now. 

Tag: V00-00-44
2012-03-12 Andy Salnikov
- add "skip-epics" option to pyana, default is true, if set to false
  then all EPICS-only datagrams are passed to framework as well

Tag: V00-00-43
2012-03-08 Andy Salnikov
- reimplement ExpNameFromXtc and ExpNameFromConfig using new class
  ExpNameDb.ExpNameDatabase

Tag: V00-00-42
2012-03-07 Andy Salnikov
- switch config.py to use SafeConfigParser, need it to pass format string
  to the module instead interpolating them
- xtc_output now implements proper chunking of the output, stream number
  can also be changed from config file

Tag: V00-00-41
2012-03-06 Andy Salnikov
- Event and Env classes have new methods to return list of event keys
- new user module event_keys to dump event keys
- xct_output module now keeps EPICS data in the events that are filtered
  out and writes those events with EPICS data in them only
- pyana now skips events that contain EPICS data only (after updating
  EPICS values in environment), this is done for better filtering support

Tag: V00-00-40
2012-02-29 Andy Salnikov
- event.Env class has new methods experiment(), instrument(), calibDir()
- implementation of experiment() and instrument() is similar to psana and
  uses the same database file, but is done in Python
- by default experiment and instrument names are guessed from xtc file 
  names but can be specified on command line or config file
- calibDir has sensible default value but can be changed from command
  line of config file as well
- new package calib with one class CalibFileFinder, very similar to
  C++ class PSCalib/CalibFileFinder. Use it to find name of the calibration 
  file for current run.
- some changes in xtc_output and pyana to pass skipped events to xtc_output

Tag: V00-00-39
2012-02-24 Andy Salnikov
- adding xtc_ouput module, the modu;le which writes datagrams
  to output file
- initial implementation, working but needs more work

Tag: V00-00-38
2012-02-15 Andy Salnikov
- add support for event loop control from user modules

Tag: V00-00-37
2012-02-11 Andy Salnikov
- adding protection for zero-size EPICS channel data in the event
- print a warning in case zero-size EPICS channel data is detected,
  not much else can be done to correct the problem, and masking it 
  completely does not look like a right thing to do

Tag: V00-00-36
2012-02-10 Andy Salnikov
- gc.collect() on every event takes too much CPU, implementing better 
  algorithm. Now GC runs only if VM size grows larger than configured 
  number since (after) last GC run. Default for delta is 10MB. This
  should avoid running it frequently for small jobs

Tag: V00-00-35
2012-02-09 Andy Salnikov
- updating python docstrings everywhere

Tag: V00-00-34
2011-12-13 Andy Salnikov
- call gc.collect() in the event loops to clean up cycles from memory,
  without this virtual size tends to grow too much

Tag: V00-00-33
2011-11-11 Andy Salnikov
- few changes to Event class, mostly transparent to users
  - constructor now takes Evn object, used internally by new 
    wrapper methods
  - get() method now returns correctly wrapped data objects
    similar to all getXxxData()

Tag: V00-00-32
2011-10-11 Andy Salnikov
- bug fix in passing epics data to subprocesses

Tag: V00-00-31
2011-10-05 Andy Salnikov
- add fix to EPICS "multi-source" data

Tag: V00-00-30
2011-08-29 Andy Salnikov
- fix for EPICS bug in multi-process mode

Tag: V00-00-29
2011-06-27 Andy Salnikov
- added support for specifying BldInfo addresses in evt.get()

Tag: V00-00-28
2011-06-27 Andy Salnikov
- implemented ordering of cspad quadrants

Tag: V00-00-27
2011-05-21 - Andy Salnikov
- modules' methods endjob, endtrun, endcalibcycle now can
  be declared with three arguments (self, evt, env) instead of
  two arguments (self, env). 
- Number of arguments is discovered at run time, so this change 
  should be backward compatible
- With three arguments the methods receive standard event object 
  which can be used to exchange data between modules. 

Tag: V00-00-26
2011-03-31 - Andy Salnikov
- fix for zero-sized Epics XTC objects

Tag: V00-00-25
2011-03-28 - Andy Salnikov
- changed method dispatch so that beginjob/endjob is called only
  once per job, not per configure/unconfigure.
- if there are multiple configure transition in the same job the 
  warning will be printed.

Tag: V00-00-24
2011-02-24 - Andy Salnikov
- previous tag accidentally "overloaded" event.get() method, doing
  proper overload now

Tag: V00-00-23
2011-02-23 - Andy Salnikov
- added support for user data stored in event

Tag: V00-00-22
2011-02-22 - Andy Salnikov
- move pyana code to a separate module pyanamod 
- can be imported into other apps and called by passing parameters 
  through keyword arguments.

Tag: V00-00-21
2010-11-09 - Andy Salnikov
- event.py: change how DroppedContribution are handled at the container 
  level while scanning XTC containers 

Tag: V00-00-20
2010-10-14 - Andy Salnikov
- some changes in cspad module need update for event class 

Tag: V00-00-19
2010-09-21 - Andy Salnikov

  in addition to standard Source level objects

Tag: V00-00-18

Tag: V00-00-17
2010-08-23 - Andy Salnikov
- bug fix, user module endrun() was not called if -n N option was given
  to pyana (https://pswww.slac.stanford.edu/trac/psdm/ticket/30) 

Tag: V00-00-16
2010-07-07 - Andy Salnikov
- in pyana update environment even if we skip the events, EPICS data 
  come at random and need to  be remembered

Tag: V00-00-15
2010-07-07 - Andy Salnikov
- added skip option to pyanato not process fist N events
- user midules may have optional begincalibcycle and endcalibcycle
  methods which will be called for appropriate transitions
- beginrun and endrun methods were made optional too
- avoid creating ROOT files when not needed

Tag: V00-00-14
2010-06-23 - Andy Salnikov
- relax a bit filtering of damaged events

Tag: V00-00-13
2010-06-22 - Andy Salnikov
- event.py: filter out all bad XTC except those having ContainsIncomplete

Tag: V00-00-12
2010-06-22 - Andy Salnikov
- histo.py fix, ROOT now is not in module scope

Tag: V00-00-11
2010-06-22 - Andy Salnikov
- process damaged events too, do not look inside damaged XTCs ad detector 
  data level
- do not import ROOT unless really necessary, it interferes badly with 
  matplotlib
- add protection when loading config objects of unknown type

Tag: V00-00-10
2010-06-17 - Andy Salnikov
- HistoMgr is instantiated on demand only
- event object now has run() method, run number is guessed from
  the file name
- disappearing sub-process should be handled better now, the main
  process detects socket errors and stops

  instead of selected subset
