               Building and installing pazlib
               ==============================

1. Pre-requisites
-----------------

The only pre-requisite for pazlib is zlib library and header files which 
should be installed already on all modern distributions. If you do not
have zlib installed either use standard distribution tools (yum/rpm,
apt-get/dpkg, etc.) to install both library and headers, or alternatively
download recent version from http://zlib.net/. 

2. Makefile
-----------

Makefile provided with a package should work on most UNIX or Linux 
platforms. Changes may be needed if your system has zlib installed in 
non-standard location which cannot be automatically found by compiler or
linker. Makefile defines two variables which are empty by default but
can be changed to point to the location of the zlib header files and
zlib library directory:

ZLIBINC = /path/to/zlib/install/include 
ZLIBLIB = /path/to/zlib/install/lib

Makefile is using gcc to compile and link shared library. If you want 
to use different compiler or options change variables CC, CFLAGS, and
LDFLAGS.

3. Building library
-------------------

To build library in local directory simply run make or 'make all',
this will create a single file libpazlib.so.

4. Installing library
---------------------

pazlib shared library is not meant to be installed in the standard 
locations and Makefile does not define any targets for installation.
To install the library in the location of your choice simply copy 
shared library to the destination directory. As usual the location
where you copy libpazlib.so should be accessible for ld.so at run
time (should be included in LD_LIBRARY_PATH).

5. Using the library
--------------------

Consult README file for details.
