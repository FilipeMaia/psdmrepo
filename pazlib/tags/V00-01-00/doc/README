Brief description:
==================

pazlib package provides parallel implementation for the zlib method
compress2(). This package builds a library which exposes that single
method. The library is meant as a drop-in replacement (or addition) 
of the standard zlib library for existing applications that need 
faster parallel compression. 

Note that only the applications that use compress2() method will be 
able to utilize pazlib, there will be no difference for all other 
clients of zlib library. Primary purpose of this project was to speed 
up compression in HDF5 library and HDF5 uses compress2().

Existing applications do not need to be re-compiled or re-linked to 
utilize the library. Instead standard pre-load mechanism should be 
used to "link" application with this library:

LD_PRELOAD=libpazlib.so myapp args ...

Alternatively if you have a choice the library can be linked to
the applications, if you do it and also include zlib (-lz) into
link make sure that -lz comes after -lpazlib.

By default pazlib creates number of compressing threads equal to 
the number of CPUs/cores on a machine. If you want to limit the
resources used by pazlib (e.g. on a shared machine) you can do it
by setting environment variable PAZLIB_MAX_THREADS to the desired 
number of threads (it cannot be larger than number of cores).
